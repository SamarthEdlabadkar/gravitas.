The principal species for biomedical research in this project was the mouse. This paper presents an overview of the scientific goals, the experimental design and the mouse training/selection program. The aim of mice experiments in the Bion-M 1 project was to elucidate cellular and molecular mechanisms, underlying the adaptation of key physiological systems to long-term exposure in microgravity. The studies with mice combined in vivo measurements, both in flight and post-flight (including continuous blood pressure measurement), with extensive in vitro studies carried out shortly after return of the mice and in the end of recovery study. Male C57/BL6 mice group housed in space habitats were flown aboard the Bion-M 1 biosatellite, or remained on ground in the control experiment that replicated environmental and housing conditions in the spacecraft. Vivarium control groups were used to account for housing effects and possible seasonal differences. Mice training included the co-adaptation in housing groups and mice adaptation to paste food diet. The measures taken to co-adapt aggressive male mice in housing groups and the peculiarities of “space” paste food are described. The training program for mice designated for in vivo studies was broader and included behavioral/functional test battery and continuous behavioral measurements in the home-cage. The results of the preliminary tests were used for the selection of homogenous groups. After the flight, mice were in good condition for biomedical studies and displayed signs of pronounced disadaptation to Earth's gravity. The outcomes of the training program for the mice welfare are discussed. We conclude that our training program was effective and that male mice can be successfully employed in space biomedical research.",Introduction,Materials and Methods,Results and Discussion,Results and Discussion,"General Outcomes Climate The environmental parameters in the biosatellite during the orbital mission, in the climatic chamber during the ground control experiment, and in the animal facility for the VC groups ( Table 4 ), were closely matched and within the acceptable range for the housing of rodents [33] , [34] . The climate parameters aboard the satellite were within the designed range throughout the flight [35] . 10.1371/journal.pone.0104830.t004 Table 4 Climate parameters in flight, control experiments and the animal facility.

Mice condition after the flight and control experiments In the flight (SF) experiment 16 out of 45 mice (36%) survived and in the ground control (GC) experiment, 38 out of 45 mice (84%) survived. It should be noted that loss of all mice (n = 15) in one assembly during space flight was a result of a gross malfunction of the food distribution system. Taking into account that the flight was aimed at exposing mice in the microgravity at, rather than evaluating the long established habitat system, survivorship would be calculated as 16 out of 30 mice (53%). Loss of mice in the SF group was obviously higher than in GC (p<0.0001, Fisher's exact test); however, the results of the control experiment are in concordance with data obtained during preliminary evaluation of the system, where none of the 15 mice died during a 30-day housing in the habitats (p = 0.1760, Fisher's exact test). Though the comparison of mice survival in our 30-day automated mission with the data obtained in the 91-day MDS experiment aboard the ISS, where astronauts attended to the mice and survival rate was 50% (3 out of 6), might be dubious, numerically the values do coincide. Upon examination of the surviving SF mice, 4 (25%) had limb injuries and 6 (38%) had various tail injuries. These results were quite unexpected taking into account that, during the preliminary evaluation of the system, all the mice remained in perfect health after 30 days of housing in the habitats. Mice behavior during the flight To better understand and interpret the fatalities and injuries sustained by some of the mice in the two functioning habitat assemblies, we made use of the uniquely rich video data that were recorded from the Bion habitats (see description, above). It should be noted that never before have such extensive video records been collected and that this design feature alone could earn the “modernization” tag in the Bion-M1 designation. The library of video recordings from the two habitat assemblies consisted of 2,476, 30-min segments of individual habitats, captured during both light and dark phases of each day of the mission, as described earlier. As might be expected, video quality was superior in the early phases of the flight and visibility was compromised over time, as floating liquids and debris tended to obscure the camera lens and the general atmosphere of the habitats. More specifically, at the beginning of first week of space flight we categorized as clear with maximal visibility 76% of the video segments. There was a precipitous decrease in visibility at the beginning of the ensuing weeks: the proportion of such clear segments was only 3% and 6% for the 2 nd and 3 rd weeks, respectively. On the first day of the final week none (0%) of the habitats were clearly visible in the video records. Two fatalities occurred in different habitats on the 2 nd day of the flight. In another cage, one mouse died on the 9 th day. There was no evidence of fighting, biting, or agonistic behavior in any of the video samples, so we do not believe that any of deaths or injuries resulted from aggression among the males, evidencing success of our effort to train and select stable housing groups. The first two losses occurred early in the flight, so lack of access to food cannot account for them; and again, in no habitat was there visual evidence of competition that prevented access to food. What might help explain the deaths? The video records clearly showed that the mice spent much time in physical contact (huddling) with one another and, significantly we think, they were grouped against the flat, feeder wall of the cylindrical habitat ( Figure 6 ). We quantified their location within each habitat on select days during the flight; choosing days on which the video segments provided good available visibility. Because we were interested in the aggregative behavior of the mice in different areas, we encoded when there were three, two or one individuals in contact with the feeder wall, the blank wall, or were in the middle area of the habitat. When one mouse was in contact with a flat wall (feeder or blank) and one or more mice were in contact with it but not necessarily with the wall itself, we scored such aggregation as being in wall contact. Using these criteria we found that during the 1 st day of flight, two or three mice were aggregated at the feeder wall for 80% (median value; range: 63%–100%) of the observable segments. They spent 0% of the time at the blank wall. On the 3 rd flight day, aggregations of two or three mice were at the feeder wall for 50% (median; range: 5%–95%) of the observation periods and at the blank wall for a median of 0% (range: 0%–11%). On Day 11, feeder wall aggregations with two or more mice occurred for a median of 46% of the observation time and there were no multiple animal aggregations at the blank wall. 10.1371/journal.pone.0104830.g006 Figure 6 A representative photograph of mice in the flight habitats. Note that mice occupy the floor grid before launch (upper row) and cling to the feeder (lower row) in microgravity. The same cages are shown. For comparison, we applied the same criteria to the Ground Control habitats for the same days during the simulated flight. Among the GC habitats on day 1, aggregations of two or three mice were seen for a median of 61% of the time (range: 46%–75%) and such aggregations were at the blank wall for only 1.5% of the time (range 0%–4%). On the third and 11 th days the median time aggregations of two or three mice were at the feeder wall was 79% and 95.5%, respectively; there were no such aggregations at the blank wall. In all, these video samples documented from the first day of experimentation, both in microgravity and on earth, that male mice aggregated non-randomly at the feeder wall of the cylindrical habitat. Individuals were often seen oriented toward the food area, which was recessed 1 cm. Whether the behavioral orientation reflected active feeding of the paste diet, or thigmotactic responses to the recess, or grasping of an edge created by the recess or presented by the rotating flap, or some combination of such factors was not discernible from the videos. It was clear, however, that both under 1-g and microgravity conditions, the animals spent most of their aggregative time, which was considerable, near or in contact with the feeder wall. In microgravity, the animals assumed a greater range of orientations at the wall and may have more actively inserted their bodies into the recesses or crevasses created by the hardware, especially the moving parts. This remains supposition, but appears likely and should be considered in future designs as well as in the arrangements for video surveillance during future flights. Results obtained in the Bion-M 1 mission should be taken into account in design of new mice habitats for future space missions. Despite the general design has long since proven its efficiency in the previous Bion flights with rats, including use of paste food and the system of its distribution, further development is needed to better adapt it for mice based on this study; obviously any moving parts in direct access of the animals should be excluded. The advantage of the habitats design is its ability to support mice without any human interference in relatively long duration missions. This degree of autonomy has not been reached by any other of the existing animal habitats, for instance, in the recent MDS mission the water tank had to be refilled every 10 days, and while food supply was designed to operate automatically for 60 days, eventually the food bars had to be manually advanced as needed by the astronauts [10] . Examination at the landing site Examination of mice after the Bion-M 1 flight directly at the landing site (return +3 h) revealed gross motor function impairment: the mice could not maintain steady posture and their fore and hind paws were positioned more to their sides, rather than directly under their trunk (14 of 16, 88%); the mice did not move even when prodded; when lifted, the mice spread their toes excessively (16/16, 100%) and righting reaction was absent or impaired in an aerial righting test (6 of 6, 100%). Some recovery of locomotor function was evident by about 6–8 h after landing, when the mice could keep normal posture and even rear. All mice were found to be exophthalmic. Excessive urinations with almost colorless urine were noted in 14 out of 16 mice. Body weight data The nutritional status of mice post-flight was variable. Whereas the majority of mice either gained some weight or maintained their pre-flight values (12/16, 75%), 1 mouse was famished (BW 50% below pre-flight value), and 3 were distinctly overweight by 30–40%. The differences in bodyweight between spaceflight, ground control and vivarium control groups were not significant (F (3,104) = 1.40, p = 0.2468) and they accounted for only 3% of total variation ( Figure 7 ). Post-hoc comparisons revealed no differences between the groups before the experiments. The comparison of pre- versus post-flight values revealed that bodyweight increased in the flight group (8%, p = 0.0010), ground control (4%, p = 0.0456) and control vivarium groups (11%, p<0.0001) with overall effect of “time” being highly significant (F(1,104) = 59.79, p<0.0001). The relations of main experimental groups (flight and control experiment groups) to the corresponding vivarium controls were mirrored: while the flight group had gained, on average, more than the mice housed in the animal facility, mice from the control experiment group gained less weight than their vivarium control counterparts. We consider that this discrepancy is explained by little opportunity for exercise in the relatively small habitats in microgravity, and partial loss of mice during the flight experiment, leading to excesses of food available to the survivors. In the control experiment, where the effort was made to reproduce the feeding regimen observed in the flight experiment, given that more mice survived, the relative amount of food per mouse was smaller leading to smaller weight gain. Seasonal variations in growth cannot be ruled out either. 10.1371/journal.pone.0104830.g007 Figure 7 Mice body weight during training (A) and bodyweight before and after the experiments (B). The pairs of bars on the (B) panel represent body weight before (left box) and after (right box) the corresponding experiment. Points represent individual mice data, boxes – lower to upper quartile, whiskers – minimum and maximum. Differences significant at p<0.05 are marked with an asterisk. Behavior in the open-field test Behavioral activity of individual mice in the open field was recorded during the training period prior to the start of the experiments and one day after landing (SF and SFV), and at corresponding times for the control groups (GC and GCV); the software for behavioral analyses extracted the nine parameters in Table 5 . After return from 30-day spaceflight mice were markedly less active, with both distance ( Figure 8A, C ) and rearing frequency ( Figure 8D ) drastically reduced compared to either GC or SFV animals, whereas grooming duration ( Figure 8H ) was much higher in SF mice compared to any of the control groups. Interestingly, both SF and GC mice who were housed in relatively small habitats displayed more pronounced thigmotaxis compared to mice kept in standard cages (SFV or GCV correspondingly), as evidenced by a decrease of center zone entries ( Figure 8E ), time spent in center ( Figure 8F ) and distance moved in center zone, while latency to the first entry into the center zone was increased in SF mice only ( Figure 8G ). Behavior parameters of mice from two vivarium groups, SFV and GCV, were indistinguishable. 10.1371/journal.pone.0104830.g008 Figure 8 Post-flight open field behavior parameters expressed as percent of pre-flight background values. Total (A), center (B) and periphery (C) distance moved, rearing frequency (D), center entries frequency (E), time in center (F), latency to the first center zone entry (G) and grooming duration (H). SF mice displayed reduced activity compared to any of the control groups (GC, SFV or GCV). Mice housed in habitats (SF and GC) were reluctant to explore the center of the arena. Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney test (*−p<0.05, **−p<0.01, ***− p<0.005 and ****−p<0.0001, ns – not significant or the p value is indicated). 10.1371/journal.pone.0104830.t005 Table 5 Open field test.

In part, housing within the restricted confines of the habitats decreased the propensity of the mice to enter and explore the center of the arena; such observations are usually interpreted in terms of increased anxiety in these animals compared to cage-housed controls [20] . Compared the flight habitat interior, animals maintained in the animal facility experienced enriched environment and such differences are associated with greater exploration of the central area in the OFT [36] . In contrast, increased housing density, experienced by SF and GC mice, had little effect on the central area exploration. In the present case the higher animal density, sometimes associated with increased central exploration and reduced anxiety [37] , did not prevail. The example of OFT data illustrates the efficacy of our training program and experimental design for promoting scientific output of the studies performed with mice after landing in the Bion-M 1 program. Because OFT activity is known to decrease with repetitive tests, the repeated testing approach used in this study could potentially obscure the effects of spaceflight. Nevertheless, the opposite was true. While some of the measures taken before the flight, e.g., distance moved, were very close in different experimental groups with variation coefficients ranging between 16 and 30%, others differed between the groups and were quite variable within the group, e.g. latency to enter central zone with within group coefficient of variation of 70–110% ( Table 5 ). In order to reduce this inter-individual and seasonal variability, results of preliminary testing were used to make the correction for baseline differences; this transformation made possible differentiation of spaceflight and habitat effects ( Figure 8 ). Post-flight adjustment of experimental groups Due to the partial loss of mice during the flight, the number of animals in other groups had to be adjusted ( Table 6 ). The number of control mice (GC, SFV, GCV) for in vitro studies was decreased proportionately to the number of SF animals available. This decision was made basing on the relatively small variability of the measures to be taken in inbred C57 mice [12] and time considerations (complete dissection of one animal lasted 1.0–1.2 hours and dissection of all the mice took more than 24 hours). Taking that accidental death of mice in flight was a random event and that bodyweight data from all the animals was available, the mice for control groups were selected to match the initial bodyweight of SF mice. Different tactics were chosen for the in vivo subgroups. The behavioral data were characterized by high variability, at the same time all the animals designated for in vivo studies underwent preliminary testing and selection, taking this into account the number of mice for in vivo studies was not altered in order to obtain a better estimate of the behavioral parameters in the batch of mice used and to increase the power of the planned analyses. 10.1371/journal.pone.0104830.t006 Table 6 Number of animals in experimental groups after post-flight adjustment.

Hemodynamic and behavioral data were collected throughout the flight. Dissection of SF and SFV mice started 12 hours after landing on May 20 th , 2013. Recovery was followed for 7 days in the in vivo subgroup of SF mice and the dissection of these animals was performed on May 26. Joint effort of teams from Russia, USA, France, Germany, Italy and Ukraine who took part in the in vivo studies and tissue-sharing program resulted in over 70 distinct hypothesis-driven studies.","Conclusions The Bion-M 1 flight was unique in many ways, particularly the unprecedented duration of an automated mission with living animals. The sex of the mice was male, thus imposing greater attention to creation and selection of stable groups of mice for social housing. The overall success was evident: aggressive interactions were noted on single occasions and under conditions of starvation only. The use of male animals is obviously required for research in male reproduction and their larger size compared to females offered clear advantages. Our program of mice training for flight and control experiments of the Bion-M 1 project was aimed to: ensure that mice adapt to stressful conditions of space flight when housed in groups; to collect baseline data from these mice; select homogenous groups; and, more generally, to promote collection of less variable data. The results of our program presented here demonstrate that group housed male mice need not be excluded a priori , but quite on the contrary, can be successfully employed in space biomedical research if clear and simple procedures provided by this study are followed. The failures in this project were connected with hardware malfunction in food distribution system and to microgravity-related changes in mouse behavior. Some of the injuries and deaths encountered in this pioneering effort suggest moving parts within the habitat present potential risks and should be avoided or carefully analyzed in the design of future mouse habitats. In this space experiment we have, for the first time, introduced implantable telemetry in these small laboratory animals. This shift to data collection during the flight became possible with the development of miniature implantable probes, thereby dramatically increasing the scientific output of such experiments. Moreover, the use of an automated data collection system during the post-flight stage of this experiment provided comprehensive data on the course and mechanism of recovery of varied physiological systems following exposure to microgravity. The unprecedented inclusion of daily video recordings proved valuable for scientific purposes, for animal welfare considerations, and for assessing both nominal and aberrant events. The good condition of spaceflight mice was the basis for the positive results of both the recovery and tissue sharing studies; leading us to conclude that our training program was generally effective. We express our hope that the results and considerations presented here will be useful for the planning of future missions and will help to ensure the welfare of rodents in space research.",Mice in Bion-M 1 space mission: training and selection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4136787/,
PMC3630201,10.1371/journal.pone.0061372,"Microgravity Induces Pelvic Bone Loss through Osteoclastic Activity, Osteocytic Osteolysis, and Osteoblastic Cell Cycle Inhibition by CDKN1a/p21",PLoS ONE,2013,"Blaber, E; Dvorochkin, N; Lee, C; Alwood, J; Yousuf, R; Pianetta, P; Globus, R; Burns, B; Almeida, E","Bone is a dynamically remodeled tissue that requires gravity-mediated mechanical stimulation for maintenance of mineral content and structure. Homeostasis in bone occurs through a balance in the activities and signaling of osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes, as well as proliferation and differentiation of their stem cell progenitors. Microgravity and unloading are known to cause osteoclast-mediated bone resorption; however, we hypothesize that osteocytic osteolysis, and cell cycle arrest during osteogenesis may also contribute to bone loss in space. To test this possibility, we exposed 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice (n = 8) to microgravity for 15-days on the STS-131 space shuttle mission. Analysis of the pelvis by µCT shows decreases in bone volume fraction (BV/TV) of 6.29%, and bone thickness of 11.91%. TRAP-positive osteoclast-covered trabecular bone surfaces also increased in microgravity by 170% (p = 0.004), indicating osteoclastic bone degeneration. High-resolution X-ray nanoCT studies revealed signs of lacunar osteolysis, including increases in cross-sectional area (+17%, p = 0.022), perimeter (+14%, p = 0.008), and canalicular diameter (+6%, p = 0.037). Expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 1, 3, and 10 in bone, as measured by RT-qPCR, was also up-regulated in microgravity (+12.94, +2.98 and +16.85 fold respectively, p<0.01), with MMP10 localized to osteocytes, and consistent with induction of osteocytic osteolysis. Furthermore, expression of CDKN1a/p21 in bone increased 3.31 fold (p<0.01), and was localized to osteoblasts, possibly inhibiting the cell cycle during tissue regeneration as well as conferring apoptosis resistance to these cells. Finally the apoptosis inducer Trp53 was down-regulated by −1.54 fold (p<0.01), possibly associated with the quiescent survival-promoting function of CDKN1a/p21. In conclusion, our findings identify the pelvic and femoral region of the mouse skeleton as an active site of rapid bone loss in microgravity, and indicate that this loss is not limited to osteoclastic degradation. Therefore, this study offers new evidence for microgravity-induced osteocytic osteolysis, and CDKN1a/p21-mediated osteogenic cell cycle arrest.",Introduction,Methods,Results,Discussion,"Methods Ethics Statement All experimental animal procedures for STS-131 were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center under protocol NAS-10-002-Y1, and conformed to the U.S. National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Animals Female, 16-week-old C57BL/6J mice (n = 8) were subjected to 15-days of spaceflight on board the space shuttle Discovery during the STS-131 mission, and as part of the NASA Biospecimen Sharing Program for the spaceflight experiment “Mouse Antigen-Specific CD4+ T Cell Priming and Memory Response during Spaceflight”. Animals used in this study were not subjected to experimental procedures during spaceflight. Animals were housed in the NASA Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) habitats for the duration of the flight and were exposed to normal day/night cycles. The NASA AEM units are composed of a stainless steel grid cage, fan blowers, a layered filter system, interior lamps, food bars and a water box. They are self-contained habitats that provide up to 8 mice with constant access to food and water while also providing a waste management system that isolates the animals from their waste and food crumbs. The AEMs were housed within a standard middeck locker on board the space shuttle. Animals were not acclimated to habitats prior to flight, but were provided with both the food bars and water bottles used in flight for at least 2 weeks prior to launch. Synchronous ground controls were also conducted using identical AEM modules. Spaceflight and synchronous ground control animals were weighed pre- and post-flight and were subjected to veterinary examination before euthanasia. Food and water consumption of each group was measured upon recovery and averaged per mouse per day. Animals were euthanized approximately 2 h after landing using isoflurane anesthesia followed by thoracotomy. Upon recovery, the pelvis and femur were dissected and the soft tissue was removed from the bones. The bone marrow was flushed from both left and right ilium and proximal femora and used for other experimental procedures not described in this paper. Care was taken to avoid disturbing the cancellous bone and bone marrow in both femoral heads during aspiration, to allow for TRAP and immunohistochemical analysis of this region. Both ilia were placed in 1 ml RNAlater at 4°C for 24 h to enable it to penetrate the bone. Vials were then transferred to −80°C and shipped on dry ice to NASA Ames Research Center for isolation of RNA and gene expression analysis. The pelvic ischium and proximal femur were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h at 4°C, washed twice with PBS, and stored in PBS at 4°C. The pelvic ischium was used for microcomputed tomography (µCT) and nano-computed tomography (nCT), while the proximal femur was used for TRAP staining and immunohistochemical analysis of proteins of interest as described below. Micro-Computed Tomography (µCT) Micro-computed tomography (µCT) was used to image and quantify bone morphometry of the ischium region in the right coxa (SkyScan 1174 microCT scanner, Kontich, Belgium). Of the original 8 samples in each group, both flight and ground control had one sample that was fractured during the dissection rendering it unsuitable for the µCT analysis (n = 7). Scanning Each ischium with soft tissue still intact, previously fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stored in PBS, was mounted vertically into a low-x-ray density Styrofoam holder, wrapped with Press-n-Seal film to prevent drying, and scanned in air. Images were acquired at 50 kV and 800 µA with 0.5 mm aluminum x-ray detector filter, a pixel resolution of 6.77 µm, voxel volume of 310.29 µm 3 , an exposure time of 3.5 s per frame with 3 averaging frames, a rotation step of 0.5°, and a rotational angle of 180°. Reconstruction Raw image data were reconstructed into a stack of 2D cross-sectional slices using NRecon volumetric reconstruction software (Skyscan v1.6.3.2). Reconstruction was carried out with a beam hardening correction of 30%, a ring artefact correction of 4, and a dynamic contrast range of 0 to 0.10. Analysis of bone structure and mineral density For analysis, a selected region of 4.89 mm (720 slices), starting from 5 slices proximal to caudal apex of the obturator foramen through ischial tuberosity ( Fig. 1A ), was analyzed using CTan software (Skyscan v1.10.9.0). A global binarization threshold of 65/255 was applied to the reconstructed images. As the mouse ischium is a thin bone with similarly sized bridge-like trabeculae connecting two opposing cortical sheets, we were unable to analyse cortical and trabecular bone regions separately. Instead we contoured along a perimeter of the cortical bone using a “shrink-wrap” custom plug-in of CTan software and analyzed them together. The following indices for mineralized tissue were investigated: total volume of region of interest (TV), bone volume of region of interest (BV), bone volume fraction (BV/TV), average thickness (Th), and mean linear attenuation coefficient. In addition to calculated indices, 3D analysis included the generation of color-coded image maps of ischial structure thickness. These images were loaded into CTvox 3D visualization program (Skyscan v1.0.or479) for a qualitative comparison of bone thickness between flight and ground control groups. To gain some insight on whether the shape of the ischium had changed with the flight environment, we examined a single cross-sectional slice, cut at the dorsal-most point of the descending ischial ramus, and measured the bend angle, the length, and the width at two points, half and one-third of the way from the proximal end ( Fig. 1D ), using CTan measurement tools. A two-tailed student’s t-test (GraphPad PRISM) was carried out to compare the means, with p-value <0.05 considered to be statistically significant. Nano-Computed Tomography (NanoCT) Following spaceflight, we performed high-resolution measurements of bone density and lacunar nanostructure using the hard X-ray Transmission Microscopy (TXM) facility at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Light Source (SSRL). Analysis was performed on similarly oriented transverse sections of cortical bone from mouse ischia near the dorsal-most point of the descending ischial ramus. Sample preparation Ischia from seven ground control and eight spaceflight mice were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stored in PBS, prior to cutting 30 µm thick cortical bone sections using single-use steel histology blades. Scanning X-ray attenuation images were acquired at 5.4 keV energy with 40 nm resolution. Triplicate 0° angle images of each sample for osteocyte lacunar and canalicular analysis were obtained with an exposure of 4 s and a beam intensity of 2. Images at 90°, were exposed for 8 s with a beam intensity of 1, and used to measure section thickness. Measurement of bone mineral density For calibration of mineral density to an X-ray attenuation curve, we used chlorapatite crystals standards and methods previously described [22] . Briefly, to account for beam intensity variations, for each synchrotron experimental run we imaged known size and mineral density chlorapatite crystal standards and plotted log x-ray attenuation relative to thicknesses in the 1 to 100 m size calibration range. Bone density was then calculated from measured 0° bone attenuation values and 90° section thickness values, relative to the standard x-ray attenuation curve. Lacunar morphometry For quantification of lacunar area, circularity, and perimeter, we used Image J software to trace lacunae in 0° angle images and measured area, circularity, and perimeter in the outlined regions of interest. To measure changes in the dimensions of canaliculi following spaceflight, we selected a 15 µm region of interest extending into the bone from the lacunar wall surface, and measured canalicular diameters. Unpaired t-test analysis was carried out to compare the means, with p-value <0.05 considered to be statistically significant. Tartrate Resistant Acid Phosphatase (TRAP) Staining The right proximal femur was used for tartrate resistance acid phosphatase staining. Bone marrow was gently aspirated from the shaft region of the femur so as not to disturb cancellous bone and bone marrow in the femoral head. Flushed bone was then demineralized using 20% EDTA for 21 days, with solution changes every three days. Decalcified bones were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and embedded in paraffin in preparation for immunohistochemical analysis. Longitudinal sections of 7 μm thickness were prepared and immediately before analysis, sections were deparaffinized in 100% xylene, and rehydrated in 100% EtOH, 95% EtOH, 75% EtOH and DI H 2 O consecutively. TRAP staining was then conducted on these sections (n = 6 sections per animal, n = 5 mice). The sections were stained for tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) using an Acid Phosphatase Leukocyte Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Catalog #387A-1KT) according to the manufacturer protocol. Images were acquired immediately after staining at magnifications of 20× and 40× using a SPOT RT slider cooled CCD camera attached to an Olympus BX51 microscope. All images were taken at the same balance, gain, and brightness. To quantify osteoclast numbers and osteoclast contact with bone surfaces we imaged the central cancellous bone region in the proximal femur just below the growth plate. Criteria for inclusion of osteoclasts in cell counts included TRAP-positive staining, at least 4 nuclei, and a contact surface with cancellous bone of at least 10 µm. Using Image J, we measured the total number of osteoclasts that met the inclusion criteria, length of cancellous bone surface, and length osteoclast contact surface with cancellous bone. The following indices for mineralized tissue were investigated: total number of osteoclasts per mm of bone surface (N.Oc./BS), and percentage of osteoclast-covered surface (Oc.S./BS). To analyze osteocytes, Image J was used to perform a cell count of TRAP-positive osteocytes and total number of osteocytes in the cortical bone immediately distal to the growth plate of the femur. All statistical analyses were performed using an unpaired t-test to determine the significant differences between ground control and spaceflight samples. RNA Isolation and RT-qPCR Analysis Total RNA was isolated from both RNAlater-fixed pelvic ilia (flushed of bone marrow) from spaceflight and ground control animals using the TRIzol method (Invitrogen). Briefly, ilia were homogenized with a hand held homogenizer in 1 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Catalog #15596-026) for 30–60 s. Homogenized samples were incubated in TRIzol for an additional 5 min, 200 μl of chloroform was added and samples were incubated for a further 3 min. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4°C. The aqueous phase containing RNA was placed into a new tube and RNA was precipitated with 600 μl of isopropanol for 10 min. Samples were centrifuged again at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4°C and the supernatant was discarded. RNA was washed with 1 ml 75% EtOH, centrifuged at 7,500 g for 5 min at 4°C, the pellet was air dried and re-dissolved in 30 μl RNase-free water. Samples were then purified using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Catalog #74104) with genomic DNA elimination step according to the manufacturers protocol. RNA concentration was measured using spectrophotometry (Nanodrop, ThermoFisher) and quality was examined with agarose gel electrophoresis. Gene expression was analyzed using Qiagen Pathway-Focused Mouse qPCR Arrays. We examined genes involved in osteogenesis, extracellular matrix, ubiquitination, and the p53, Pi3K, NFκB, and MAP Kinase, signaling pathways in bone tissue. Each array consisted of primer sets for 84 pathway-focused genes of interest, five reference genes (Gusb, Hprt1, Hsp90ab1, Gapdh, and Actb), one genomic DNA contamination control, three positive PCR controls and three positive reverse transcription controls on a 96 well plate. One μg of total RNA per sample (n = 6) was reverse transcribed to cDNA using RT 2 First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (SABiosciences, Catalog #330401) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, genomic DNA elimination buffer was added to the sample and incubated at 42°C for 5 min. Reverse transcription cocktail containing primers, external controls and RT enzyme mix was then added to the samples and samples were incubated at 42°C for 15 min and the reaction was stopped by incubation at 95°C for 5 min. The cDNA was mixed with RT 2 SYBR Green/Rox qPCR master mix and equal volumes (25 μl) were added to PCR plates. Plates were sealed with optical thin-walled 8-cap strips (Qiagen, Catalog #1065667) and qPCR of sample arrays was performed using an Applied Biosystems 7500 Real Time PCR instrument. Real-time PCR conditions were as follows: one cycle 95°C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min, followed by one cycle of 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 1 min, 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 15 s. Gene expression levels from all arrays were analyzed for alterations in expression levels as compared to ground controls (n = 6, p<0.05) using a PCR Array Data Analysis Template (v3.2, SABiosciences). Data analysis was based on the ΔΔCt method and gene expression levels were normalized to four reference genes (Gusb, Hprt1, Gapdh, and Actb). Immunohistochemical and Immunocytochemical Analysis Sections of the right-proximal femur prepared as described above for TRAP Staining were also used for immunohistochemical and immunocytochemical analysis. The following primary polyclonal antibodies were used in the immunohistocehmical analysis: anti-p21 (1∶50 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p53 (1∶50 dilution, Santa-Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Matrix Metallopeptidase 10 (1∶20 dilution, Novus Biologicals) and anti-Mdm2 (1∶25 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Peroxidase conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG was used as the secondary antibody (1∶5000 dilution, Jackson Immunoresearch). Briefly, sections were immersed in sodium citrate buffer for 10 min at 95°C, washed in DI water and immersed in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4 (2×5 min). Sections were then blocked in 10% normal blocking serum (Donkey serum in PBS-T) for a period of 1 h in a moist chamber at room temperature. Primary antibody incubation was conducted in a moist chamber at 4°C overnight. Sections were washed in PBS-T and incubated with peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody in a moist chamber at room temperature for 1 h and then rinsed with PBS-T and incubated in peroxidase substrate for 12–30 min until staining was complete. Sections were washed in DI water and dehydrated in 75%, 95% and 100% EtOH followed by 100% xylene for 3 min at each stage. Sections were mounted in mounting medium and visualized using an Olympus BX51 light microscope. For osteocyte nuclear localization, we used Hoechst 33342 staining (500 ng/ml in DI water for 10 min at room temperature, Invitrogen, Catalog #H1399) on deparaffinized sections of the right-proximal femur prepared as described above. Lacunae with and without Hoechst stained nuclei, and nuclear pyknotic morphology were used to quantify osteocyte apoptosis.",Conclusions,"Microgravity induces pelvic bone loss through osteoclastic activity, osteocytic osteolysis, and osteoblastic cell cycle inhibition by CDKN1a/p21",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3630201/,

This review examines the effects of microgravity on biological processes and their implications for human health. Microgravity significantly impacts the immune system by disrupting key mechanisms, such as T cell activation, cytokine production, and macrophage differentiation, leading to increased susceptibility to infections. In cancer biology, it promotes the formation of spheroids in cancer stem cells and thyroid cancer cells, which closely mimic in vivo tumor dynamics, providing novel insights for oncology research. Additionally, microgravity enhances tissue regeneration by modulating critical pathways, including Hippo and PI3K-Akt, thereby improving stem cell differentiation into hematopoietic and cardiomyocyte lineages. At the organ level, microgravity induces notable changes in hepatic metabolism, endothelial function, and bone mechanotransduction, contributing to lipid dysregulation, vascular remodeling, and accelerated bone loss. Notably, cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells and cultured under microgravity exhibit enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, improved calcium handling, and advanced structural maturation, including increased sarcomere length and nuclear eccentricity. These advancements enable the development of functional cardiomyocytes, presenting promising therapeutic opportunities for treating cardiac diseases, such as myocardial infarctions. These findings underscore the dual implications of microgravity for space medicine and terrestrial health. They highlight its potential to drive advances in regenerative therapies, oncology, and immunological interventions.

However, contemporary studies have indicated heterogeneity within adult stem-cell pools, and a novel culturing technique may address these limitations by selecting those for cell proliferation which are highly functional. Here, we report the preservation of stemness in human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) by using microgravity conditions combined with microspheres in a stirred suspension. The cells were bound to microspheres (100−300 μm) and cultured using a wave-stirring shaker. One-week cultures using polystyrene and collagen microspheres increased the proportions of SSEA-3(+) hASCs 4.4- and 4.3-fold (2.7- and 2.9-fold increases in their numbers), respectively, compared to normal culture conditions. These cultured hASCs expressed higher levels of pluripotent markers (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, MYC, and KLF), and had improved abilities for proliferation, colony formation, network formation, and multiple-mesenchymal differentiation. We believe that this novel culturing method may further enhance regenerative therapies using hASCs.",1. Introduction,2. Materials and Methods,3. Results,4. Discussions,,5.

A key aspect of achieving these goals is to operate the ISS National Lab more like an Earth-based laboratory, conducting complex end-to-end experimentation, not limited to simple microgravity exposure. Towards that end NASA developed a novel suite of molecular biology laboratory tools, reagents, and methods, named WetLab-2, uniquely designed to operate in microgravity, and to process biological samples for real-time gene expression analysis on-orbit. This includes a novel fluidic RNA Sample Preparation Module and fluid transfer devices, all-in-one lyophilized PCR assays, centrifuge, and a real-time PCR thermal cycler. Here we describe the results from the WetLab-2 validation experiments conducted in microgravity during ISS increment 47/SPX-8. Specifically, quantitative PCR was performed on a concentration series of DNA calibration standards, and Reverse Transcriptase-quantitative PCR was conducted on RNA extracted and purified on-orbit from frozen Escherichia coli and mouse liver tissue. Cycle threshold (Ct) values and PCR efficiencies obtained on-orbit from DNA standards were similar to Earth (1 g) controls. Also, on-orbit multiplex analysis of gene expression from bacterial cells and mammalian tissue RNA samples was successfully conducted in about 3 h, with data transmitted within 2 h of experiment completion. Thermal cycling in microgravity resulted in the trapping of gas bubbles inside septa cap assay tubes, causing small but measurable increases in Ct curve noise and variability. Bubble formation was successfully suppressed in a rapid follow-up on-orbit experiment using standard caps to pressurize PCR tubes and reduce gas release during heating cycles.

Irradiation acutely stimulates bone remodeling in mice, although the long-term influence of space radiation on bone-forming potential (osteoblastogenesis) and possible adaptive mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that ionizing radiation impairs osteoblastogenesis in an ion-type specific manner, with low doses capable of modulating expression of redox-related genes. 16-weeks old, male, C57BL6/J mice were exposed to low linear-energy-transfer (LET) protons (150 MeV/n) or high-LET 56 Fe ions (600 MeV/n) using either low (5 or 10 cGy) or high (50 or 200 cGy) doses at NASA’s Space Radiation Lab. Five weeks or one year after irradiation, tissues were harvested and analyzed by microcomputed tomography for cancellous microarchitecture and cortical geometry. Marrow-derived, adherent cells were grown under osteoblastogenic culture conditions. Cell lysates were analyzed by RT-PCR during the proliferative or mineralizing phase of growth, and differentiation was analyzed by imaging mineralized nodules. As expected, a high dose (200 cGy), but not lower doses, of either 56 Fe or protons caused a loss of cancellous bone volume/total volume. Marrow cells produced mineralized nodules ex vivo regardless of radiation type or dose; 56 Fe (200 cGy) inhibited osteoblastogenesis by more than 90% (5 weeks and 1 year post-IR). After 5 weeks, irradiation (protons or 56 Fe) caused few changes in gene expression levels during osteoblastogenesis, although a high dose 56 Fe (200 cGy) increased Catalase and Gadd45 . The addition of exogenous superoxide dismutase (SOD) protected marrow-derived osteoprogenitors from the damaging effects of exposure to low-LET ( 137 Cs γ) when irradiated in vitro, but had limited protective effects on high-LET 56 Fe-exposed cells. In sum, either protons or 56 Fe at a relatively high dose (200 cGy) caused persistent bone loss, whereas only high-LET 56 Fe increased redox-related gene expression, albeit to a limited extent, and inhibited osteoblastogenesis. Doses below 50 cGy did not elicit widespread responses in any parameter measured. We conclude that high-LET irradiation at 200 cGy impaired osteoblastogenesis and regulated steady-state gene expression of select redox-related genes during osteoblastogenesis, which may contribute to persistent bone loss.",1.

In small animals, such as in rats and mice, cyclic loading experiments are particularly challenging to perform in a precise manner due to the small size of the bones and difficult-to-eliminate machine compliance. Addressing this issue, we developed a precise method for ex vivo cyclic compressive loading of isolated mouse vertebral bodies. The method has three key characteristics: 3D-printed support jigs for machining plano-parallel surfaces of the tiny vertebrae; pivotable loading platens to ensure uniform contact and loading of specimen surfaces; and specimen-specific micro-CT-based finite element analysis to measure stiffness to prescribe force levels that produce the same specified level of strain for all test specimens. To demonstrate utility, we measured fatigue life for three groups ( n = 5–6 per group) of L5 vertebrae of C57BL/6J male mice, comparing our new method against two methods commonly used in the literature. We found reduced scatter of the mechanical behavior for this new method compared to the literature methods. In particular, for a controlled level of strain, the standard deviation of the measured fatigue life was up to 5-fold lower for the new method (F-ratio = 4.9; p < 0.01).

While irradiation-induced embrittlement has been attributed to changes in the collagen molecular structure, the relative role of collagen fragmentation versus non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking remains unclear. To better understand the effects of radiation on the bone material without cellular activity, we conducted an ex vivo x-ray radiation experiment on excised mouse lumbar vertebrae. Spinal tissue from twenty-week old, female, C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to a single x-ray radiation dose of either 0 (control), 50, 1,000, 17,000, or 35,000 Gy. Measurements were made for collagen fragmentation, non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking, and both monotonic and cyclic-loading compressive mechanical properties. We found that the group differences for mechanical properties were more consistent with those for collagen fragmentation than for non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking. Monotonic strength at 17,000 and 35,000 Gy was lower than that of the control by 50% and 73% respectively, ( p < 0.001) but at 50 and 1,000 Gy was not different than the control. Consistent with those trends, collagen fragmentation only occurred at 17,000 and 35,000 Gy. By contrast, non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking was greater than control for all radiation doses ( p < 0.001). All results were consistent both for monotonic and cyclic loading conditions. We conclude that the reductions in bone compressive monotonic strength and fatigue life due to ex vivo ionizing radiation are more likely caused by fragmentation of the collagen backbone than any increases in non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks.",,,,,,,Effects of ex vivo ionizing radiation on collagen structure and whole-bone mechanical properties of mouse vertebrae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6813909/,

Mutations in and loss of DGC proteins cause a spectrum of muscular dystrophies. When only the sarcoglycan subcomplex is absent, muscles display severe myofiber degeneration, but little susceptibility to contractile damage, suggesting that disease occurs not by structural deficits but through aberrant signaling, namely, loss of normal mechanotransduction signaling through the sarcoglycan complex. We extended our previous studies on mechanosensitive, γ-sarcoglycan-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation, to determine whether additional pathways are altered with the loss of γ-sarcoglycan. Methods We examined mechanotransduction in the presence and absence of γ-sarcoglycan, using C2C12 myotubes, and primary cultures and isolated muscles from C57Bl/6 (C57) and γ-sarcoglycan-null (γ-SG -/- ) mice. All were subjected to cyclic passive stretch. Signaling protein phosphorylation was determined by immunoblotting of lysates from stretched and non-stretched samples. Calcium dependence was assessed by maintaining muscles in calcium-free or tetracaine-supplemented Ringer’s solution. Dependence on mTOR was determined by stretching isolated muscles in the presence or absence of rapamycin. Results C2C12 myotube stretch caused a robust increase in P-p70S6K, but decreased P-FAK and P-ERK2. Neither Akt nor ERK1 were responsive to passive stretch. Similar but non-significant trends were observed in C57 primary cultures in response to stretch, and γ-SG -/- cultures displayed no p70S6K response. In contrast, in isolated muscles, p70S6K was mechanically responsive. Basal p70S6K activation was elevated in muscles of γ-SG -/- mice, in a calcium-independent manner. p70S6K activation increased with stretch in both C57 and γ-SG -/- isolated muscles, and was sustained in γ-SG -/- muscles, unlike the transient response in C57 muscles. Rapamycin treatment blocked all of p70S6K activation in stretched C57 muscles, and reduced downstream S6RP phosphorylation. However, even though rapamycin treatment decreased p70S6K activation in stretched γ-SG -/- muscles, S6RP phosphorylation remained elevated. Conclusions p70S6K is an important component of γ-sarcoglycan-dependent mechanotransduction in skeletal muscle. Our results suggest that loss of γ-sarcoglycan uncouples the response of p70S6K to stretch and implies that γ-sarcoglycan is important for inactivation of this pathway. Overall, we assert that altered load-sensing mechanisms exist in muscular dystrophies where the sarcoglycans are absent.",,Methods,Results,Discussion,,Conclusions,Absence of gamma-sarcoglycan alters the response of p70S6 kinase to mechanical perturbation in murine skeletal muscle,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4095884/,

These proteins are involved in diverse cellular processes, including vacuole biogenesis and stress tolerance. A previously uncharacterized protein, named TNO1 (for TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein), was identified by coimmunoprecipitation as a SYP41-interacting protein. TNO1 was found to localize to the TGN by immunofluorescence microscopy. A tno1 mutant showed increased sensitivity to high concentrations of NaCl, KCl, and LiCl and also to mannitol-induced osmotic stress. Localization of SYP61, which is involved in the salt stress response, was disrupted in the tno1 mutant. Vacuolar proteins were partially secreted to the apoplast in the tno1 mutant, suggesting that TNO1 is required for efficient protein trafficking to the vacuole. The tno1 mutant had delayed formation of the brefeldin A (BFA) compartment in cotyledons upon application of BFA, suggesting less efficient membrane fusion processes in the mutant.

Here, we characterize the presumed Drosophila ortholog of the mammalian SUN protein, sperm-associated antigen 4 (Spag4, previously named Giacomo), and demonstrate that Spag4 is required for centriole and nuclear attachment during spermatogenesis. Production of spag4 mRNA is limited to the testis, and Spag4 protein shows a dynamic pattern of association with the germline nuclei, including a concentration of protein at the site of attachment of the single spermatid centriole. In the absence of Spag4, nuclei and centrioles or basal bodies (BBs) dissociate from each other after meiosis. This role of Spag4 in centriolar attachment does not involve either of the two KASH proteins of the Drosophila genome (Klarsicht and MSP-300), but does require the coiled-coil protein Yuri Gagarin. Yuri shows an identical pattern of localization at the nuclear surface to Spag4 during spermatogenesis, and epistasis studies show that the activities of Yuri and dynein-dynactin are downstream of spag4 in this centriole attachment pathway.

In addition, microorganisms can become more virulent in space, causing further challenges to health. To understand these issues better and to contribute to design of effective countermeasures, we used the Drosophila model of innate immunity to study immune responses in both hypergravity and spaceflight. Focusing on infections mediated through the conserved Toll and Imd signaling pathways, we found that hypergravity improves resistance to Toll-mediated fungal infections except in a known gravitaxis mutant of the yuri gagarin gene. These results led to the first spaceflight project on Drosophila immunity, in which flies that developed to adulthood in microgravity were assessed for immune responses by transcription profiling on return to Earth. Spaceflight alone altered transcription, producing activation of the heat shock stress system. Space flies subsequently infected by fungus failed to activate the Toll pathway. In contrast, bacterial infection produced normal activation of the Imd pathway. We speculate on possible linkage between functional Toll signaling and the heat shock chaperone system.

Microarray data from cardiomyocytes of male C57BL/6 mice followed-up for 28 days after exposure to 900 mGy of 1 GeV proton or 150 mGy of 1 GeV/n 56 Fe were compared to human endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured for 7 days on the International Space Station (ISS). We observed common molecular pathways between simulated space radiation and HUVECs flown on the ISS. The analysis suggests FYN is the central driver/hub for the cardiovascular response to space radiation: the known oxidative stress induced immediately following radiation would only be transient and would upregulate FYN , which in turn would reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, protecting the cardiovascular system. The transcriptomic signature of exposure to protons was also much closer to the spaceflight signature than 56 Fe’s signature. To our knowledge, this is the first time GeneLab datasets were utilized to provide potential biological indications that the majority of ions on the ISS are protons, clearly illustrating the power of omics analysis.

The shotgun metagenomics data of the ISS generated during the Microbial Tracking–1 (MT-1) project and resulting metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) across three flights in eight different locations during 12 months were used in this study. The objective of this study was to identify the AMR genes associated with whole genomes of 226 cultivable strains, 21 shotgun metagenome sequences, and 24 MAGs retrieved from the ISS environmental samples that were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA; viable microbes). Results We have analyzed the data using a deep learning model, allowing us to go beyond traditional cut-offs based only on high DNA sequence similarity and extending the catalog of AMR genes. Our results in PMA treated samples revealed AMR dominance in the last flight for Kalamiella piersonii , a bacteria related to urinary tract infection in humans. The analysis of 226 pure strains isolated from the MT-1 project revealed hundreds of antibiotic resistance genes from many isolates, including two top-ranking species that corresponded to strains of Enterobacter bugandensis and Bacillus cereus .

Additionally, there is growing evidence that suggests that not only is the immune system being altered, but the pathogens that infect the host are significantly influenced by spaceflight and ground-based spaceflight conditions. In this study, we demonstrate that Serratia marcescens (strain Db11) was significantly more lethal to Drosophila melanogaster after growth on the International Space Station than ground-based controls, but the increased virulence phenotype of S. marcescens did not persist after the bacterial cultures were passaged on the ground. Increased virulence was also observed in bacteria that were grown in simulated microgravity conditions on the ground using the rotating wall vessel. Increased virulence of the space-flown bacteria was similar in magnitude between wild-type flies and those that were mutants for the well-characterized immune pathways Imd and Toll , suggesting that changes to the host immune system after infection are likely not a major factor contributing towards increased susceptibility of ground-reared flies infected with space-flown bacteria. Characterization of the bacteria shows that at later timepoints spaceflight bacteria grew at a greater rate than ground controls in vitro, and in the host. These results suggest complex physiological changes occurring in pathogenic bacteria in space environments, and there may be novel mechanisms mediating these physiological effects that need to be characterized.",Introduction,Materials and methods,Results,Discussion,,,Innate immune responses of Drosophila melanogaster are altered by spaceflight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7000411/,

Drosophila can be sent to space in large numbers to examine the effects of microgravity on heart structure and function, which is fundamentally conserved from flies to humans. Flies reared in microgravity exhibit cardiac constriction with myofibrillar remodeling and diminished output. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in isolated hearts revealed reduced expression of sarcomeric/extracellular matrix (ECM) genes and dramatically increased proteasomal gene expression, consistent with the observed compromised, smaller hearts and suggesting abnormal proteostasis. This was examined further on a second flight in which we found dramatically elevated proteasome aggregates co-localizing with increased amyloid and polyQ deposits. Remarkably, in long-QT causing sei/hERG mutants, proteasomal gene expression at 1 g , although less than the wild-type expression, was nevertheless increased in microgravity. Therefore, cardiac remodeling and proteostatic stress may be a fundamental response of heart muscle to microgravity.",INTRODUCTION,STAR★METHODS,RESULTS,DISCUSSION,,,Prolonged Exposure to Microgravity Reduces Cardiac Contractility and Initiates Remodeling in Drosophila,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7787258/,

Efficient root elongation and bending depends upon the coordinated action of environmental sensing, signal transduction, and growth responses. The actin cytoskeleton is a highly plastic network that constitutes a point of integration for environmental stimuli and hormonal pathways. In this review, we present a detailed compilation highlighting the importance of the actin cytoskeleton during primary root growth and we describe how actin-binding proteins, plant hormones, and actin-disrupting drugs affect root growth and root actin. We also discuss the feedback loop between actin and root responses to light and gravity. Actin affects cell division and elongation through the control of its own organization. We remark upon the importance of longitudinally oriented actin bundles as a hallmark of cell elongation as well as the role of the actin cytoskeleton in protein trafficking and vacuolar reshaping during this process. The actin network is shaped by a plethora of actin-binding proteins; however, there is still a large gap in connecting the molecular function of these proteins with their developmental effects. Here, we summarize their function and known effects on primary root growth with a focus on their high level of specialization. Light and gravity are key factors that help us understand root growth directionality. The response of the root to gravity relies on hormonal, particularly auxin, homeostasis, and the actin cytoskeleton. Actin is necessary for the perception of the gravity stimulus via the repositioning of sedimenting statoliths, but it is also involved in mediating the growth response via the trafficking of auxin transporters and cell elongation. Furthermore, auxin and auxin analogs can affect the composition of the actin network, indicating a potential feedback loop. Light, in its turn, affects actin organization and hence, root growth, although its precise role remains largely unknown. Recently, fundamental studies with the latest techniques have given us more in-depth knowledge of the role and organization of actin in the coordination of root growth; however, there remains a lot to discover, especially in how actin organization helps cell shaping, and therefore root growth.",Introduction: The Actin Cytoskeleton and Primary Root Growth,,,,,,Regulation of plant gravity sensing and signaling by the actin cytoskeleton.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8716943/,

This phenomenon, called gravitropism, is influenced by most of the major plant hormones including brassinosteroids. Epi-brassinolide (eBL) was previously shown to enhance root gravitropism, a phenomenon similar to the response of roots exposed to the actin inhibitor, latrunculin B (LatB). This led us to hypothesize that eBL might enhance root gravitropism through its effects on filamentous-actin (F-actin). This hypothesis was tested by comparing gravitropic responses of maize ( Zea mays ) roots treated with eBL or LatB. LatB- and eBL-treated roots displayed similar enhanced downward growth compared with controls when vertical roots were oriented horizontally. Moreover, the effects of the two compounds on root growth directionality were more striking on a slowly-rotating two-dimensional clinostat. Both compounds inhibited autotropism, a process in which the root straightened after the initial gravistimulus was withdrawn by clinorotation. Although eBL reduced F-actin density in chemically-fixed Z. mays roots, the impact was not as strong as that of LatB. Modification of F-actin organization after treatment with both compounds was also observed in living roots of barrel medic ( Medicago truncatula ) seedlings expressing genetically encoded F-actin reporters. Like in fixed Z. mays roots, eBL effects on F-actin in living M. truncatula roots were modest compared with those of LatB. Furthermore, live cell imaging revealed a decrease in global F-actin dynamics in hypocotyls of etiolated M. truncatula seedlings treated with eBL compared to controls. Collectively, our data indicate that eBL-and LatB-induced enhancement of root gravitropism can be explained by inhibited autotropic root straightening, and that eBL affects this process, in part, by modifying F-actin organization and dynamics.",Introduction,Materials and Methods,Results,Discussion,"Discussion In this paper, a slowly-rotating 2-D clinostat was used to gain additional insights into actin-mediated regulation of directional root growth. These experiments showed that brassinosteroids were involved in modulating directional root growth, in part, by modifying the organization and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. This conclusion was based on the observation that exogenous application of eBL and LatB triggered similar enhanced root gravitropism and amplified root coiling on a clinostat ( Figure 1 ). The curvature responses of roots treated with eBL and LatB during continuous gravistimulation and on a clinostat are reminiscent of the behavior of inflorescence stems of A. thaliana myosin XI and actin8 mutants ( Kato et al., 2010 ; Okamoto et al., 2015 ; Talts et al., 2016 ). The hyperbending of inflorescence stems of myosin and actin A. thaliana mutants was proposed to be the result of inhibited autotropism. With an aberrant acto-myosin system in fiber cells, it was proposed that the stems could no longer perceive their posture to initiate a straightening response ( Okamoto et al., 2015 ). Here, we propose that a similar mechanism may be operating in roots, and that eBL is a component of the root organ straightening response through its impacts on F-actin. Most of the studies implicating the actin cytoskeleton in gravitropism have emphasized its role in the gravity perception phase ( Blancaflor, 2013 ; Su et al., 2017 ). In gravity sensing cells such as the columella, actin has been proposed to interact with amyloplasts to facilitate conversion of the physical gravity signal to a biochemical signal ( Zheng et al., 2015 ). Because actin inhibitors such as LatB or mutations to genes encoding actin itself led to stronger root gravitropic curvature ( Yamamoto and Kiss, 2002 ; Hou et al., 2003 ; Kato et al., 2010 ; Lanza et al., 2012 ), it was proposed that the unrestrained sedimentation of amyloplasts may amplify the gravity sensing signal leading to a more robust graviresponse ( Blancaflor, 2013 ). However, work on A. thaliana myosin XI mutants ( Okamoto et al., 2015 ) and results presented here, suggest a more prominent role for actin in the graviresponse phase, and more specifically in the autotropic straightening response that enables plant organs to correct their orientation ( Stankovic et al., 1998a ; Stanković et al., 1998b ). Furthermore, given the difficulties in obtaining clear images of F-actin in the columella ( Figure 3 ), we cannot rule out the possibility that a secondary mechanism of gravity sensing in the root transition zone might be affected by LatB ( Wolverton et al., 2002 ). A number of studies have implicated eBL in directional root growth control. For instance, eBL application mirrored the enhanced root waving and gravitropism of A. thaliana actin2 mutants and caused disruptions in F-actin configurations in wild type ( Lanza et al., 2012 ). Enhanced root gravitropism was also observed in wild-type A. thaliana roots treated with eBL and this process was proposed to be mediated by ROP2-dependent modification of F-actin assembly and disassembly ( Li et al., 2005 ). While our results expand on these previous observations, experiments with a clinostat implicated eBL as a potential regulator of autotropism, and like previous results with LatB-treated roots, provide an alternative explanation of why this hormone has an apparent promotive effect on gravitropism. Although previous studies have shown that eBL modifies F-actin organization in A. thaliana roots ( Lanza et al., 2012 ), we found that eBL effects on F-actin organization in fixed Z. mays roots and living M. truncatula roots were not as pronounced and consistent as those induced by LatB. Higher concentrations of eBL were needed to elicit distinct qualitative and quantitative changes in F-actin in both chemically-fixed Z. mays roots and living M. truncatula roots. In fact, it was surprising to find that 1 µM eBL led to increased F-actin occupancy values compared to controls, while concentrations lower (500 nM) or higher (5 µM) than 1 µM led to reduced values ( Figure 2B ). Moreover, F-actin occupancy and bundling in living roots treated with 5 µM eBL was not different from untreated controls ( Figures 5B, C ). LatB-treatment on the other hand, led to an increase in F-actin bundling, which was likely due to aggregation of F-actin fragments in some of the root cells analyzed. Although occupancy and bundling were not affected by eBL, we found that eccentricity of F-actin in LatB- and eBL-treated roots were reduced relative to controls ( Figure 5D ). It is tempting to speculate that eBL-induced reduction in F-actin alignment alone is sufficient to account for a large part of the root autotropic inhibition observed here. It is important to note, however, that all of the F-actin analyses reported here were conducted pre-clinorotation. It is possible that changes in F-actin organization during the process of clinorotation were unaccounted for in our analyses. Experiments involving chemically fixing roots at various time points during clinorotation or a system in which live roots expressing the F-actin reporters can be imaged on a clinostat, will be necessary to address such possibilities. Okamoto et al. (2015) proposed that the long F-actin cables in the inflorescence stem fiber cells were the structures that modulated organ straightening possibly by regulating cytoplasmic streaming. It is possible that eBL regulation of root autotropic straightening is facilitated by a population of F-actin in specific root cell types that are not detected by the quantitative metrics used in our studies. This could explain why eBL had only modest effects on overall F-actin organization, but still caused LatB-like autotropic straightening defects. Another possibility is that dampening of global F-actin dynamics by eBL as revealed by live cell imaging of etiolated M truncatula hypocotyls could account for autotropic straightening defects. Suppressed global F-actin dynamics after eBL exposure could modify targeting of plasma membrane-associated proteins, such as PIN2, leading to dampened autotropism ( Li et al., 2005 ; Lanza et al., 2012 ). Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain global F-actin dynamic data on M. truncatula root cells because of technical difficulties associated with keeping actively growing roots within the microscope field of view. As such, a direct link between root F-actin dynamics and root autotropism is missing. For the future, a suitable clinostat assay using M. truncatula shoots should help clarify if reduced global F-actin dynamics can explain eBL effects on organ straightening. Furthermore, live fluorescent protein-based F-actin marker lines in Z. mays could help strengthen the link between F-actin organization and autotropic organ growth ( Wu et al., 2013 ). For more than a decade, genetically-encoded F-actin reporters based on fluorescent protein technology have advanced our understanding of actin function during plant development ( Voigt et al., 2005 ; Wang et al., 2008 ). In addition to new insights into the processes underlying directional root growth control, our work introduces a set of M. truncatula lines expressing two types of genetically encoded F-actin reporters. These new F-actin reporter lines could potentially be used to address a range of biological questions. Specifically, a future gravitational biology-related study in which these new M. truncatula lines would be of value is the dynamic monitoring of F-actin in various tissues of graviresponding roots using vertical stage microscopy ( Von Wangenheim et al., 2017 ). Vertical stage microscopy combined with new imaging modalities such as airy scan should enable super-resolution of F-actin during plant gravity response ( Komis et al., 2018 ). Moreover, some light sheet microscopy platforms allow for plant organs to be positioned vertically. Such methods pave the way for long term and volumetric imaging of F-actin dynamics during plant gravity response using these new M. truncatula lines ( Ovečka et al., 2018 ). Similar to previous reports in A. thaliana plants expressing live cell F-actin reporters ( Ketelaar et al., 2004 ; Dyachok et al., 2014 ), mature M. truncatula plants expressing Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP appear to have growth defects based on their reduced shoot and root dry weights when compared to controls. However, the negative growth effects induced by expressing these reporters were mild and not very pronounced in young seedlings. Thus, if used with caution, these Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP M. truncatula lines should be a valuable addition to existing fluorescent protein-based toolkit for studying dynamic cellular processes in legumes ( Ivanov and Harrison, 2014 ; Cvrckova and Oulehlova, 2017 ; Zhang et al., 2019 ). In conclusion, our results implicate brassinosteroids in root autotropism. Brassinosteroids modulate this process by modifying F-actin organization and dynamics in a manner different from that of the actin-disrupting compound LatB. Regardless of the mechanisms by which eBL modifies F-actin, our studies reinforce previous observations that the acto-myosin system is an important component of plant tropistic responses. Finally, through our work, we introduced a set of M. truncatula lines expressing fluorescent protein-based reporters that could enable new studies of actin-mediated processes in legumes.",Data Availability Statement All datasets for this study are included in the article/ Supplementary Material .,Brassinosteroids inhibit autotropic root straightening by modifying filamentous-actin organization and dynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7010715/,

The data were analyzed using SEDFIT to determine if the samples had come to equilibrium, and SEDPHAT [23] was used to fit the sedimentation equilibrium data to a single species model. Multispeed analysis with mass-conservation constraints was performed, allowing the time-invariant and radially invariant noise elements to be calculated and subtracted from the data [23] . A 68.3% confidence interval was calculated as previously described [24] , [25] . The error number reported is the average of the positive and negative deviations from best mass value. For the determination of the amount of detergent bound per gram of protein (δ D ), buffer without detergent was used in the reference sector, and two different concentrations (41 and 66 µM) of MscL were placed in the sample sector. The volume of each sample and reference was 390 µl. The rotor speed used was 50,000 rpm, and the temperature setting was 20°C. The data were analyzed in SEDFIT using the non-interacting discrete species model [26] , [27] . The flotation of the detergent micelles (the density of LDAO is less than that of water) was explicitly accounted for by giving that species a negative sedimentation coefficient. The amounts of absorbance units and interference fringes present for the main sedimenting species were derived from this analysis. Using the calculated extinction coefficient of the protein and the known refractive index increments of the detergent and the protein, δ D was calculated as in le Maire et al. [28] . Subsequent sedimentation velocity experiments were performed with 20, 32, and 64 µM SaMscL samples in 4 mM LDAO at 50,000 rpm at 20°C. The volume centrifuged was 390 µL. In these cases, the reference buffer contained the same [LDAO] as the sample. The absorbance data (interference data were not collected) were initially analyzed using the c ( s ) model in SEDFIT [26] . Although LDAO has a very low extinction coefficient at 280 nm, its floatation was detectable; the range of data near to the meniscus was therefore eliminated for this analysis. In these analyses, small quantities (2%–3% of the total signal) of large species were detected. Using this information, all species, including the floating detergent, were modeled in the “species analysis” model in SEDPHAT [26] . This approach is referred to as the “ s and D ” method in the text, because both the sedimentation coefficient and the diffusion coefficient are refined to arrive at the buoyant molar mass ( M b ). M b was transformed to M (the molar mass of the protein) using the formula (1) where (2) [29] The symbol ρ is the solution density, is the partial specific volume of the protein, and is the partial specific volume of the detergent. Any lipids bound to SaMscL were neglected in these calculations. M b was also calculated using the relationship (3) where N 0 is Avogadro's number, η is the solution viscosity, R s is the Stokes radius of the protein/detergent complex, and s is the sedimentation coefficient. The Stokes radius of the protein was obtained by calibrating the SEC column described above with proteins of known Stokes radius. R s for SaMscL in LDAO was 4.2 nm. Again, M b was transformed to M using Eq. 1. Values for , η , and ρ were estimated using the program SEDNTERP [30] . The value of was taken as 1.13 mL/g [31] . Confidence intervals of s and M b were calculated as detailed above. A confidence interval for the value of Stokes radius, which was derived from a linear regression, was: where t is the t statistic, s s is the estimate of σ for the regression line, V e is the elution volume of MscL from the SEC column, is the average elution volume of the standards, n is the number of standards, and S VV is the sum of squared deviations of the individual standard compared to . In cases of asymmetric error intervals, the σ was taken as the average of the difference between the boundary value and the best-fitted value. Because multiple experiments, each having different errors, were performed, the value of M reported in the main text is the weighted mean μ w ± the weighted σ ( σ w ), calculated using the formulas: for the I experiments preformed ( i = 3 in this case).",,S. aureus MscL is a pentamer in vivo but of variable stoichiometries in vitro: implications for detergent-solubilized membrane proteins,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2998437/,

Previous studies have recognized that this channel has properties that make it ideal for use as a triggered nanovalve for vesicular-based targeted drug-release devices. One can even change the modality of the sensor. Briefly, the introduction of charges into the MscL pore lumen gates the channel in the absence of membrane tension; thus, by inserting compounds that acquire a charge on exposure to an alternative stimulus, such as light or pH, into the pore of the channel, controllable nanoswitches that detect these alternative modalities have been engineered. However, a charge in the pore lumen could not only encourage actuation of the nanopore but also have a significant influence on the permeation of large charged compounds, which would thus have important implications for the efficiency of drug-release devices. In this study, we used in vivo and electrophysiological approaches to demonstrate that the introduction of a charge into pore lumen of MscL does indeed influence the permeation of charged molecules. These effects were more drastic for larger compounds and, surprisingly, were related to the orientation of the MscL channel in the membrane.—Yang, L-M, Blount, P.

Two MscL crystal structures of the orthologs M. tuberculosis and S. aureus have been solved showing pentameric and tetrameric structures, respectively. Several studies followed to understand whether the discrepancy in their stoichiometry was a species difference or a consequence of the protein manipulation for crystallization. Two independent studies now agree that the full-length S. aureus MscL is actually a pentamer, not tetramer. While detergents appear to play a role in modifying the oligomeric state of the protein, a cytoplasmic helical bundle has also been implicated. Here, we evaluate the role of the C-terminal region of S. aureus MscL in the oligomerization of the channel in native membranes by using an in vivo disulfide-trapping technique. We find that the oligomeric state of S. aureus MscLs with different C-terminal truncations, including the one used to obtain the tetrameric S. aureus MscL crystal structure, are pentamers in vivo .

X-ray crystallography reveals a homo-pentameric complex with each subunit containing two transmembrane α-helices (TM1 and TM2) and a single carboxyl terminal α-helix arranging within the complex to form a five-fold cytoplasmic bundle (CB), whose function and stability remain unclear. In this study, we show three routes that throttle the open channel conductance. When the linker between the TM2 and CB domain is shortened by deletions or constrained by either cross linking or heavy metal coordination, the conductance of the channel is reduced; in later two cases, even reversibly.

The physiological role of MscL is that of an emergency release valve that opens a large pore upon a sudden drop in the osmolarity of the environment. A crystal structure of a closed state of MscL shows it as a homopentamer, with each subunit consisting of two transmembrane domains (TM). There is consensus that the TM helices move in an iris like manner tilting in the plane of the membrane while gating. An N-terminal amphipathic helix that lies along the cytoplasmic membrane (S1), and the portion of TM2 near the cytoplasmic interface (TM2 ci ), are relatively close in the crystal structure, yet predicted to be dynamic upon gating. Here we determine how these two regions interact in the channel complex, and study how these interactions change as the channel opens. We have screened 143 double-cysteine mutants of E. coli MscL for their efficiency in disulfide bridging and generated a map of protein-protein interactions between these two regions.

This easily translates into several atmospheres of additional pressure that can build up within the cell. Without a protective mechanism against such pressures, the cell will lyse. Hence, most microbes appear to possess members of one or both families of bacterial mechanosensitive channels, MscS and MscL, which can act as biological emergency release valves that allow cytoplasmic solutes to be jettisoned rapidly from the cell.

Nevertheless, some animals evolved anhydrobiosis, a strategy allowing for the reversible organism dehydration and suspension of metabolism as a direct response to habitat desiccation.

In this study, the eutardigrade Paramacrobiotus spatialis was used to investigate the occurrence of ROS associated with the desiccation process. We observed that the production of ROS significantly increases as a function of time spent in anhydrobiosis and represents a direct demonstration of oxidative stress in tardigrades. The degree of involvement of bioprotectants, including those combating ROS, in the P. spatialis was evaluated by perturbing their gene functions using RNA interference and assessing the successful recovery of animals after desiccation/rehydration. Targeting the glutathione peroxidase gene compromised survival during drying and rehydration, providing evidence for the role of the gene in desiccation tolerance. Targeting genes encoding glutathione reductase and catalase indicated that these molecules play roles during rehydration.

With PWS, bone and muscle changes were generally proportional to the degree of unloading. Specifically, total body and hindlimb bone mineral density, calf muscle mass, trabecular bone volume of the distal femur, and cortical area of the femur midshaft were all linearly related to the degree of unloading. Even a load reduction to 70% of normal weight bearing was associated with significant bone deterioration and muscle atrophy.

In this study, we tested the effects of mBMPR1A‐mFc on disuse‐induced bone loss caused by 21 days of hindlimb unloading (HLU) via tail suspension versus cage controls (CONs). Adult female C57BL/6J mice (12 weeks old) were assigned to one of four groups ( n = 10 each): CON‐VEH; CON‐mBMPR1A‐mFc; HLU‐VEH; and HLU‐mBMPR1A‐mFc.

Furthermore, the increased abundance of transcripts, such as Pfkfb3 and Mss51, after HLU imply these genes also have roles in the cortical bone’s response to altered mechanical loading. Our study demonstrates that an unbiased approach to assess the whole transcriptomic profile of cortical bone can reveal previously unidentified mechanosensitive genes and may eventually lead to novel targets to prevent disuse-induced osteoporosis.",Introduction,Material and methods,Results,Discussion,,,RNAseq and RNA molecular barcoding reveal differential gene expression in cortical bone following hindlimb unloading in female mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8509868/,

Since astronauts may be exposed continually to a complex space radiation environment unlike that experienced on Earth, it is unresolved whether there is a risk to cardiovascular health during long-term space exploration missions. Previously, we have described that mice exposed to a single dose of simplified Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR 5-ion ) develop cardiovascular dysfunction by 12 months post-radiation. Methods: To investigate the biological basis of this dysfunction, here we performed a quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of heart tissue (proteome and phosphoproteome) and plasma (proteome only) from these mice at 8 months post-radiation. Results: Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) for irradiated versus sham irradiated samples (fold-change ≥1.2 and an adjusted p -value of ≤0.05) were identified for each proteomics data set. For the heart proteome, there were 87 significant DEPs (11 upregulated and 76 downregulated); for the heart phosphoproteome, there were 60 significant differentially phosphorylated peptides (17 upregulated and 43 downregulated); and for the plasma proteome, there was only one upregulated protein. A Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) technique that assesses canonical pathways from BIOCARTA, KEGG, PID, REACTOME, and WikiPathways revealed significant perturbation in pathways in each data set. For the heart proteome, 166 pathways were significantly altered (36 upregulated and 130 downregulated); for the plasma proteome, there were 73 pathways significantly altered (25 upregulated and 48 downregulated); and for the phosphoproteome, there were 223 pathways significantly affected at 0.1 adjusted p -value cutoff. Pathways related to inflammation were the most highly perturbed in the heart and plasma. In line with sustained inflammation, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were demonstrated to be increased in GCR 5-ion irradiated hearts at 12-month post irradiation. NETs play a fundamental role in combating bacterial pathogens, modulating inflammatory responses, inflicting damage on healthy tissues, and escalating vascular thrombosis. Discussion: These findings suggest that a single exposure to GCR 5-ion results in long-lasting changes in the proteome and that these proteomic changes can potentiate acute and chronic health issues for astronauts, such as what we have previously described with late cardiac dysfunction in these mice.",Introduction,Methods,Results,Discussion,"Discussion Based on data from epidemiological studies, it takes a significant amount of time for cardiovascular disease to develop (up to decades). There is relatively little knowledge regarding the time frame to develop cardiovascular disease from exposure to the space radiation environment. Here, we undertook a multi-proteomics approach to characterize protein and pathway perturbations that occurred in hearts and plasma from mice exposed to a single dose of GCR 5-ion 8 months prior. One of the most interesting observations was that across the three data sets, the abundance of the majority of the DEPs diminished in the heart and plasma at 8 months post radiation. While one acute effect of radiation is to cause fragmentation and aggregation of protein molecules ( Kumta and Tappel, 1961 ), it is possible that the effects observed at 8 months post radiation may be due to the inhibition of protein synthesis. We previously reported that microgravity, another stressor of space travel, reduced protein turnover in cardiomyocytes ( Feger et al., 2016 ) and speculated that this diminishment in protein synthesis could lead to overall reduction in cardiomyocyte protein content. Calmodulin 2 (CALM2), a signaling protein involved in the calcium-regulated contraction of cardiac muscle ( Beghi et al., 2022 ), was one of the most highly perturbed proteins in the heart proteome in this study. We examined the expression levels of CALM2 as well as an associated kinase (CAMKG2) via Western blots but did not see a statistical difference in abundance of either protein in the hearts of GCR 5-ion irradiated mice compared to unirradiated controls ( Supplementary Figures S2A, S3C ). Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were also performed on hearts from irradiated and sham irradiated mice to validate markers of complement activation (C4d and C4b-BP; Supplementary Figure S3 ) and coagulation/clotting/fibrin formation (fibrinogen alpha, fibrinogen beta, fibrinogen gamma; Supplementary Figures S2C, S3 ). From this analysis, only fibrinogen gamma was statistically significantly different between hearts from irradiated and sham irradiated mice as observed via Western blot analysis ( Supplementary Figure S2H ). In the plasma proteome, the most significantly regulated protein was major urinary protein 20 (MUP20) which was upregulated in irradiated animals. MUP20 is a male pheromone which promotes aggressive male behavior, stimulates female sexual attraction to male urinary scent, promotes a strong learned attraction to the airborne urinary odor of an individual male, and promotes spatial learning by rapidly conditioning preference for its remembered location among females and competitor males so that animals prefer to spend time in the site even when scent is absent ( Roberts et al., 2010 ; Roberts et al., 2010 ; Demir et al., 2020 ). While this finding may not be translatable since humans are the only placental mammals found not to have any active MUP genes ( Logan et al., 2008 ), the finding of MUP20 dysregulation in male mice exposed to GCR 5-ion may illuminate behavioral and learning changes following exposures of rodents to various GCR components. Other proteins dysregulated in the plasma following GCR irradiation are serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) (upregulated) and glutathione S-transferase theta-3 (GSTT3) (downregulated). SAA1 is a major acute-phase protein mainly produced by hepatocytes in response to infection, tissue injury, and malignancy. SAA has anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting platelet aggregation and by reducing the oxidative burst in Polymorphonuclear neutrophils( Zimlichman et al., 1990 ; Gatt et al., 1998 ). SAA also has proinflammatory effects, such as induction of extracellular matrix degrading enzymes, allowing the repair of tissue damage and inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1B, IL-6, and TNFa ( Uhlar and Whitehead, 1999 ). GSTT3 is expressed strongly in the liver (and to a lesser extent in kidney and testis). Glutathione transferases play a significant role in the metabolism/detoxification process of a wide range of electrophilic compounds that include mutagens, carcinogens, reactive oxygen species, and some therapeutic agents. The most highly impacted pathways in the heart tissue were inflammation/complement/coagulation, mitochondria, and cell cycle/transcription (CCTR). The downregulation of the mitochondrial pathways is in line with the comprehensive Azimzadeh et al. review of omics data from radiation induced-cardiovascular disease ( Azimzadeh et al., 2022 ). However, in our study, the CCTR cluster was the most highly affected, as detailed in Supplementary Figure S1 , which shows the 72 CCTR processes that are downregulated in the heart 8 months post GCR irradiation. This global downregulation in cell cycle and transcription processes may help explain the overall diminishment in protein abundance noted earlier in the discussion. Perhaps the most interesting finding from this study involves neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs have come to the forefront of immunology for their fundamental role in combating bacterial pathogens. Beyond this defensive capacity, intriguingly, NETs have shown the ability to modulate inflammatory responses, even within sterile environments ( Papayannopoulos, 2018 ). One remarkable illustration of this involves the role of cholesterol crystals in prompting the formation of NETs, which subsequently stimulate macrophages to unleash IL-1-beta, a process known to expedite the development of atherosclerosis ( Warnatsch et al., 2015 ). This process becomes particularly concerning when a plaque rupture transpires. The resulting exposure of endovascular NETs can escalate vascular thrombosis, a factor intimately tied to severe cardiovascular events like acute myocardial infarction and stroke ( Klopf et al., 2021 ). Our study has unveiled some illuminating findings in this area. Employing proteomic analysis, we discovered that the NETs formation pathway was activated in mice exposed to Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR), and myocardium sections exhibited a significant accumulation of NETs in these mice after long-term high-energy GCR exposure. Our findings align with previous research wherein, in a mouse bladder cancer model receiving radiation therapy, NETs were found to promote their formation through the protein HMGB1 via a TLR4-dependent pathway both in vitro and in vivo ( Shinde-Jadhav et al., 2021 ). Notably, the accumulation of NETs and its components in local areas can inflict damage on healthy tissues. Prior research has linked the increased expression of NETs in the inflamed myocardium to gene expression of collagen type I (Col1a1) and increased the heart stiffness in mouse models ( Bai et al., 2019 ). This correlation may explain our previous findings, which demonstrated decreased systolic heart function and increased arterial elastance 1 year after GCR exposure, as revealed through cardiac-pressure-volume loop analysis ( Bishawi et al., 2022 ). From our limited tissue samples, we observed an increased presence of type I collagen in the GCR-exposed mice, but no significant difference in type III collagen between the two groups (see Supplementary Figure S4 ). Evidence for persistent activity, as indicated by markers such as MPO and elastase, was noted 8 months post-exposure. However, this study did not include additional markers such as plasma enrichment, quantification of NETotic neutrophils, cleaved caspases, and condensed nuclei, which could have provided further insights into the sustained nature of NETs activity. The findings underscore the need for a more comprehensive investigation with an expanded sample size, controlled left ventricular mass data, and methodical sampling at regular intervals throughout the study to evaluate this phenomenon more accurately. NETs have also been shown to promote the development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in mouse models ( Brill et al., 2012 ). A complication associated with cardiovascular degeneration during space flight that was recently brought to light is the occurrence of venous thromboembolisms (VTEs). Approximately 2 months into a mission aboard the International Space Station in 2019, a female astronaut noticed an abnormality during an ultrasound examination ( Auñón-Chancellor et al., 2020 ). Upon further examination and consultation with physicians on Earth, the astronaut was diagnosed with a left internal jugular venous thrombosis. The astronaut presented with no signs or symptoms, and she had no family or personal history of venous thromboembolisms. A therapeutic regimen was quickly established for the astronaut and she was luckily treated in a timely manner. This incidence exemplifies the unknown health consequences associated with unique stressors of the space environment. Although there are other confounding factors that may have contributed to the astronaut’s hypercoagulable state, there is evidence that her exposure to space radiation was a primary constituent. We found NETs presentation in the myocardium, but no significant enrichment of inflammatory cytokines was identified in the plasma. Neutrophils serve as the first-line of innate immunity. The cytokines that trigger NETs formation might be detectable during the acute injury stage. Thus, there is a pressing need for another study that collects samples shortly after GCR exposure to accurately determine what triggers NETs. While the exact mechanism behind NET formation following GCR exposure remains elusive in our study and whether NET formation may have played a role in the astronaut’s development of VTE is unknown, we propose a hypothesis involving chronic tissue damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) activation post-radiation exposure as potential mechanisms, warranting further investigation.","Data availability statement The original contributions presented in the study are publicly available.

If we assume gravity has remained constant during the species' evolution, will its sensory system adapt to abrupt loss of that force? We address this question in the land snail Helix lucorum exposed to 30 days of near weightlessness aboard the Bion-M1 satellite, and studied geotactic behavior of postflight snails, differential gene expressions in statocyst transcriptome, and electrophysiological responses of mechanoreceptors to applied tilts. Each approach revealed plastic changes in the snail's vestibular system assumed in response to spaceflight. Absence of light during the mission also affected statocyst physiology, as revealed by comparison to dark-conditioned control groups. Readaptation to normal tilt responses occurred at ~20 h following return to Earth. Despite the permanence of gravity, the snail responded in a compensatory manner to its loss and readapted once gravity was restored.",Introduction,Materials and methods,Results,Discussion,"Discussion Behavioral studies Upon entry into orbit the satellite is in a constant free fall back toward Earth and the traveler feels weightless. The neural gravity sensors that control normal balance and equilibrium are now forced to operate in a unique environment. The present experiments sought to identify the consequences of a 30-day orbital mission on the behavioral performance of snails challenged by a vestibular perturbation after return to normal 1G starting 14–15 h after landing. To account for possible environmental and habitat factors of unmanned spaceflights that can affect measured parameters of behavior other than those related to the state of weightlessness, we designed four control groups based on housing, food and water availability, and lighting, and included a landing-like simulation. In brief, we found that the behavioral phases most directly correlated with gravity sensation were the most affected by the vestibular perturbations tested as soon as the snails reached the laboratory after landing. To distinguish μG-affected parameters, we made multiple group analysis of variance comparisons for each variable ( q.v . Supplementary Materials). It reveals significant changes in the early phase of gravitaxis reaction parameters in the postflight (PF) group: the degree of tentacles withdrawal at the initial phase 0 was smaller (Figure 2B ), and followed by shorter latency of tentacles protraction (T0, Figure 1C ). Both findings were replicated in the data from an earlier 12-day Foton-M3 mission (T0 latency at the tendency level, phase 0 withdrawal highly significant; Figure S2 ). After the snail pivots to the head-up position (late T3-T4 phases), the length of tentacles becomes shorter in the PF group in comparison to 3 control groups (Figure 2 ). At the same time in the fourth control group, termed statocyst-affected “overloading” (landing simulation, OL), the tentacle length at T4 is significantly higher than that of the PF snails or any control snail, a finding that promotes a speculation on the opposite effect of overloading (hypergravity) and unloading (μG) exposure on the functions controlled by snail statocysts. The cause of a lesser T2 latency in Foton-M3 postflight group in comparison to Bion-M1 PF group may be attributed to smaller snails used in Foton-M3 project (3–8 vs. 8–25 g, muscle mass/shell weight ratio is higher for young snails, allowing faster movements). We studied subgroups of young snails (3–8 g) in OL controls, but no correlation of T2 duration with weight was found ( q.v . Supplementary Data). For the gravitaxis reaction, the snails affected by prolonged μG exposure show stronger correlations with snail weight than do control snails (Figure 3 ), thus suggesting a probable explanation of a shorter T2 phase in Foton-M3 postflight snails. Snails belonging to the same genus of Helix ( H. aspersa ), the common garden snail, were exposed to increased gravitation by centrifugation for 16 and 32 days and showed an increased latency or slowing of T3 phase of gravitaxis (Popova and Boyle, 2015 ). In the data of Bion-M1 project opposite effects in PF snails to the control snails were not seen. There is no consistency between the different Bion-M1 control groups in this parameter, although two groups with most controlled conditions (DK and OL) did show shorter T1-T4 latencies than PF group. For Foton-M3 data (with comparable snail size used), all available latencies (up to T2) are shorter than in preflight controls, thus in agreement with the hypothesis that gravitaxis temporal parameters will change in an opposite fashion after μG than after hypergravity. No differences in T4 duration between μG PF and control groups of snails were found in the data of Bion-M1, also in agreement with the previous study of hypergravity influences and the assumption that the T4 phase may reflect more motor than vestibular function in snails (Popova and Boyle, 2015 ). A correlation analysis of Bion-M1 behavioral data found T1-T4 phase latencies and durations were positively correlated among themselves in both PF and joined control snails, suggesting a stability of gravitaxis speed during the entire T1-T4 sequence (“slow snails are always slow”). The tentacle length in phases T1-T4 in both PF and control snails showed a positive inter-relation, suggesting the stability of withdrawal reaction during gravitaxis reaction (“afraid snails are always afraid”). Inter-tentacle angles are also positively correlated among themselves during the entire gravitaxis reaction (0-T4), although to a lesser extent than tentacle length and temporal parameters, probably due to the transient nature of this parameter. The tentacle lengths at T0 in the four merged control groups showed weak negative correlations with temporal parameters, together with T0 latency with tentacle length at many phases (Figure 3A ). This finding may be interpreted that snails exhibiting more fear (retract tentacles shorter) complete the gravitaxis reaction more slowly. For PF snails such a correlation disappears (Figure 3B ), supposedly because the disturbance of statocysts function shortly after landing results in less confidence to vestibular stimuli (habituation of response). Vestibular stimuli sensed by statocysts were shown to be connected to tentacles withdrawal and generalized defensive reaction in snails (see Figure 6 here; Balaban, 1993 ). Pierantoni ( 1983 ) showed the connection of the vertical angle of tentacles and the function of snail statocysts using a spinning disk, and speculated that the vertical angle between the tentacles and the surface is associated with fear in the snail and will depend on the inclination of surface. Inter-tentacle angle in land snails has been investigated mostly in the context of olfactory orientation (Chase and Croll, 1981 ; Davis, 2004 ; Davis-Berg, 2012 ), although tentacle connection with collumellar musculature and hydroskeleton may provide some mechanistic relation of the inter-tentacle angle with muscular or hydraulic tonus of snail; for example, in experiments with predatory snails inter-tentacle angle seems to be correlated with speed of snail crawling (Davis, 2004 ; Davis-Berg, 2012 ). In our experiments inter-tentacle angles were measured from the screenshots of different phases of gravitaxis reaction, and the analysis revealed a tendency of the angle to become narrower in late phases in all groups of Bion-M1 and Foton-M3 experiments (Figures S1A , S2C ). No specific effects of prolonged μG (PF snails) or short centrifugation (OL snails) on inter-tentacle angle were found in Bion-M1 experiments, although a decrease of inter-tentacle angle in all phases of gravitaxis was found in Foton-M3 experiment (Figure S2C ). A possible cause for this discrepancy is a difference of experimental design: repeated testing of snails in Foton-M3 project as opposed to only one test in Bion-M1 snails. Both PF and OL groups show differences in opposite directions in comparison to three other controls in tentacle length at late gravitaxis phase T4 (Figure 2A ). Both groups are statocyst-affected, but in an opposite direction, as OL snails were shortly centrifuged, and PF snails were exposed to prolonged μG (plus very similar overloads as OL during landing). In our physiological experiments no changes in background statocyst activity were found, but the response to vestibular stimulation was significantly stronger in PF group in comparison to control groups, and responses of OL group were weaker compared to other control groups (Figure 7 ). Such physiological differences may underlie the observed behavioral differences. Transcriptome analysis of statocysts The changes in neural cells' morphology, biochemistry and genes expression under space flight conditions are widely accepted (Honda et al., 2012 ; Pani et al., 2013 ; Ranjan et al., 2014 ; Tsybko et al., 2015 ; Wang et al., 2016 ; Porseva et al., 2017 ). Among the most significant differentially expressed genes in PF snails are the neuronal specific precursors of neuropeptides, neurotransmitter receptor subunits, and other genes involved in cell signaling. Gene expression of both the pedal and FMRF-amide peptides were tested by in situ hybridization in earlier Foton studies (Balaban et al., 2011 ), and were found to be differentially expressed in Bion-M1 PF snails in comparison to ST control snails. In the present Bion-M1 study the genes for these peptides were significantly downregulated in PF-e samples (see Figure 5 and Table S1 ). In Foton studies preproFMRF-amide gene was found unaltered in control and postflight statocysts using the ISH technique, and preproHPep was found to be upregulated in certain receptor cells. Such discrepancy with Bion-M1 may be explained at least in part by different sensitivity of methods used and also a different Helix species ( Helix aspersa L.) was used in Foton-M3 ISH experiment. Adaptation to spaceflight and readaptation process The present study confirmed the electrophysiological findings observed in two earlier Foton satellite missions (Balaban et al., 2011 ). This study also benefitted from the earlier Foton missions: an earlier animal return to the lab after touchdown was achieved (chartered jet and police escort from the airport) and the experimental protocols evolved to capture as much data as possible in the shortest period of time. Statocyst responses in PF snails of Bion-M1 were comparable to their counterparts in Foton-M3 (see Figure 8 ), despite more than a 2-fold difference in mission duration. The finding of a postflight hypersensitivity to tilt was confirmed at the level of the whole nerve and single statoreceptor analyses (see Figures 11 – 13 ). The statocyst background rate remained unchanged as in the 2007 mission. These findings suggest we measured on a plateau portion of the sensitivity adaptation process, and that the mechanisms underlying in-flight changes, i.e., the μG-induced influence, in statocyst responses are established before 12 days in orbit. We were able to identify the critical time of readaptation to Earth 1G, at ~20 h after landing. Interestingly, hypersensitivity of sensory neurons after spaceflight was found not only in vestibular system, but also in mechanosensory receptors of human skin (Lowrey et al., 2014 ). The response sensitivity of utricular afferents in the vertebrate toadfish, Opsanus tau , taken post-landing of the orbiters STS-90 (NeuroLab; 16 days in orbit) and STS-95 (9 days in orbit) missions revealed an induced profound hypersensitivity to translational acceleration tests (Boyle et al., 2001 ). Recordings were also made in separate populations of afferents at numerous time periods after landing to track the rate of recovery. Although some afferents remained hypersensitive, the population as a whole recovered within 24–36 h comparable to readaptation time of snail sensory cells and experienced astronauts, and a bit shorter than a 2–3 day space motion sickness period reported in astronauts during 1G readaptation following 6-month manned missions (Heer and Paloski, 2006 ). It can be argued in the vertebrate that the rate of adaptation to spaceflight and its recovery after return to Earth are more consistent with a restructuring of the synaptic organization between the hair cells and the afferents, such as adjusting the number of synaptic ribbons or bodies (Ross, 2000 ), than a restructuring the weight-lending otolith (see below). The toadfish study could not identify whether the hypersensitivity originated in the hair cell, the hair cell-afferent complex, or postsynaptically in the afferent itself. In our Foton and Bion-M1 studies in the snail statocyst we recorded directly from the output of the statoreceptors themselves. Although it is tempting to speculate that the hair cells in vertebrates are also the targets of the sensitivity adjustment to altered gravity loads, direct evidence is still lacking. Vestibular sensitivity in the statocyst of the garden snail was recently studied following exposure to hyper-gravity conditions using centrifugation (Popova and Boyle, 2015 ). A significant decrease in response sensitivity to head-down tilt was detected after 16- and 32-day (but not 4-day) exposures to a 1.4G [resultant = √1G (Earth) 2 + 1G (centripetal) 2 ]. After a 7-day recovery period in normal 1G the responses returned to normal. In accordance with the present study the prevalent gravity level appears represented as a continuum in statocyst function over the measured periods of time. Critical data that are missing and subject to future investigations are the initial responses of the statocyst and organism to an abrupt change in gravity load, the functional and structural consequences of long-term exposure to altered gravity, and the time course of recovery of function as a function of load and duration of exposure. Light cycle influences on the statocyst response Activity recorded in the lip sensory nerve in semi-intact Helix preparations can reflect the circadian phase to which the snail is adapted (Voss et al., 1997 ). In that study chemical stimuli presented in the light elicited an increased neural response when they corresponded in time to the snail's normal active phase of behavior, viz . scotophase. This species is known to have an endogenous circadian oscillator entrained by light (Bailey and Lazaridou-Dimitriadou, 1986 ; Attia, 2004 ), and the circadian pattern of locomotor activity remains with a period of ~25 h in constant darkness for at least 20 days (Bailey and Lazaridou-Dimitriadou, 1986 ). The interpretation of the present results must take the influences of the light-dark cycle into consideration. Bion-M1 PF snails arrived at the lab in the evening, and the physiological recordings were mostly completed that night. The ST and NV control snails on the other hand were recorded during the daytime. If the statocyst contains a self-sustained peripheral circadian oscillator, it may affect the physiological responses we measured. To exclude such a possibility we performed an additional experiment that confirmed the statocyst response was independent of the circadian time in our preparation (Figure S5 ). However, the two Bion-M1 control groups with controlled dark conditions (DK and OL, 30 days in dark, recorded in scotophase) and the Foton-M3 control group (DK2007, 12 days in dark, recorded in daytime) show a decreased statocyst response in comparison to ST (natural light cycle, ~16L:8D) and NV (12:12 h LD cycle) control groups (see Figures 7 , 8 ). Despite housed in the dark during the missions, Bion-M1 PF and PF2007 snails showed an increased statoreceptor sensitivity to tilt stimuli, whether recorded at night or during the daytime. This increase sensitivity found only in PF snails was presumably the result of the space environment and not from influences of the housing or time of recording. How these external factors interact to shape the statocyst response is unclear, as well as whether or not the interaction occurs at the same site of plasticity. Another route through which the light-dark cycle might modulate the statocyst activity is via the vestibular efferent fibers (Williamson, 1986 ; Janse et al., 1988 ; Tsubata et al., 2003 ; Sakakibara et al., 2005 ), that may be entrained by a central circadian oscillator (Attia, 2004 ). We compared the peri-stimulus curves of efferent activity and found no significant difference between PF and control snails (see Figure 10 ), thereby excluding the efferent neurons of dynamically modulating the statocyst response on a tilt-by-tilt basis. Whether the substrate for an effect of light-dark cycle is within the statocyst itself or elsewhere remains to be determined. Inertial mass as adaptation mechanism A widely discussed mechanism of adaptation to the μG environment is an adjustment of the weight of statoconia (invertebrates) or otoconia (vertebrates) (Wiederhold et al., 2000 ; Edelmann, 2002 ; Gorgiladze, 2002 ). Deposition of calcium carbonate will affect a change in the mass, but not the weight, in space, but would reveal itself after return to the normal gravity. Ultrastructural studies in Helix found statoconia growth, i.e., size and amount, after long-term exposures to μG on Mir and ISS space stations (Gorgiladze, 2002 ; Gorgiladze et al., 2011 ). In Gorgiladze's ( 2002 ) study, statoconia size increased with μG exposures between 40 and 148 days, but for shorter exposures the data less clear as the statoconia size after 14 days was larger than after 31 days. Statoconia growth was reversed after return to 1G in about 30 days. In their postflight snails the statoconia were often incrustated by “flakes” or covered by a layer of distinctive crust indicating a deposition of calcium carbonate. Our limited morphological data from Bion-M1 postflight statoconia did not show any of these characteristic features (see Figure 4 ). However, caution is needed because our sample size was restricted to a single animal in 3 groups and the flight durations were not similar. This compensatory process requires more examination. One more factor is pertinent to the different results reported in Helix studies: in our study adult animals (20–25 g) were used, whereas in the previous studies snails were either juvenile (0.3–2 g) or young adults (9–15 g). The effect of statoconia growth in μG was more pronounced in young snails (Gorgiladze, 2002 ), and was insignificant in adult fish otoconia (Wiederhold et al., 2003 ). In addition, our physiological data showed no difference in the magnitude of the sensitivity changes between the postflight groups of our separate missions having different duration of μG exposure (shown in Figure 8 ). Thus, there is no substantive evidence for a mechanism inducing a change in statoconia mass for snails exposed to μG for less than a month. For the process of readaptation to normal gravity, postflight groups of Bion-M1 and Foton-M3 studies both divided into two distinct subgroups by the critical time of recording 20 h after landing. It is even less likely that changes in statoconia play any role in this readaptation process of such short duration. Taking into account 20 h as critical time of readaptation, neural plasticity of statocyst sensory statoreceptors themselves, central circuits, or both might be better candidates. Role of efferent vestibular neurons The vertebrate inner ear sensory organs receive centripetal innervation of their hair cells (and the dendrites of afferent neurons) by centrally located efferent neurons. This strategy is also present in snail statocyst: the statocyst nerve contains the axons of the statoreceptors as well as axons of neurons from the cerebral ganglion on each side. How the efferent neurons influence the gravity and acceleration sensations during and after space flight is unknown. Assuming the efferent innervation serves to tune the receptor's response to acceleration in a behaviorally relevant context (Goldberg et al., 2002 ; Boyle et al., 2009 ; Rabbitt et al., 2010 ), μG might trigger a shut down of the efferent system to allow an amplification of any input, now weak or absent, signal. If so, this might temporarily lead to a hypersensitivity in snail statoreceptors. In an attempt to address this key issue, we analyzed the firing behavior of presumed efferent neurons to tilt and found it was monotonous within each examined group of snails. Thus, direct evidence that the efferents play a role in the postflight statoreceptor hypersensitivity was not found. We cannot rule out however that the efferent neurons were studied in a behaviorally irrelevant context, namely in the isolated neural preparation and not in the intact animal, and postflight but not inflight. Directionality of response and single unit analysis Previously we reported (Balaban et al., 2011 ) that the differential sensitivity of statocyst responses to stimuli of different directions (c1 > c2, c3, c4) seen in control snails was lost in the Foton-M3 postflight snails, and we hypothesized a weakening of directional selectivity might occur immediately after spaceflight. Here, we replicated this finding in the Bion-M1 control groups, but the PF snails of Bion-M1 remained spatial tuned to preferred directions (Figures S8 , S9 ). Because of the robustness of the new results we reject our earlier hypothesis that spaceflight influences directional selectivity. Directional selectivity was also maintained in vertebrate otolith afferents with hypersensitivity after spaceflight (Boyle et al., 2001 ) and in centrifuged snails having reduced overall tilt sensitivity (Popova and Boyle, 2015 ). We consider this spatial tuning as a fundamental property of statocyst function and not readily susceptible to plastic changes. By spike sorting of the statocyst nerve activity we were able to distinguish the activity of single sensory cells. In some cases the cell activity could identify its possible location in the statocyst, like ventrally located ciliary cells or frontally from caudally located cells. We tried in all cases to find the directionality at the single unit level, but the most active cells in our records frequently showed little to no direction tuning to tilt presented in our protocol; these cells are presumably ventrally located in the statocyst and code more the position of animal in space than stimulus direction (see Figure 11 ). In the nudibranch Hermissenda the 13 statocyst sensory cells have cilia organized for multidirectional sensitivity (Kuzirian et al., 1981 ). In Helix some statocyst sensory cells might share a form of this organization in functional terms. Using single unit analysis we identified a few sensory cells that responded to only one of the two tested directions of tilt with a phasic-tonic reaction (see Figure 12 ). If we consider this to represent a multidirectional sensitivity of a statoreceptor, this type of response might be constructed in frontally and caudally located statoreceptors by a physical contact only with the edge of the inertial mass in the horizontal position of statocyst. Activity of these cells allows the CNS to decode the direction of stimuli from the statocyst output. Comparing the activity of identified statoreceptors, position-coding ventrally located cells form between 50 and 80% of the statocyst output (for OL: ~20 spikes/s, for PF-e: ~30 spikes/s during tilt), and direction-coding cells contribute ~15% of the net response. The only viable candidate to explain the existence of directional response with higher sensitivity (“head down,” c1) is the unpaired sensory neuron at the anterior pole of the statocyst (see Figure 13 ). Responding to perturbations of vertical orientation of the organism, including human, in the “head down” direction are of critical importance for self-protection, and the unpaired sensory neuron at the anterior pole of the statocyst adds to the net information signal of tilt stimuli in this biologically meaningful direction. Marine mollusks require a fast and reliable recognition of spatial orientation from variable external cues to maintain proper balance and 3D navigation in the sea, and thus their statocyst is the most studied among invertebrates (Wood and Von Baumgarten, 1972 ; Alkon, 1975 ; Janse, 1983 ; Budelmann and Williamson, 1994 ; Deliagina et al., 1998 ). In freshwater species, pulmonate Lymnaea , the statocyst output is important for periodical trips to the surface for breathing (Janse, 1982 ). Janse et al. ( 1988 ) compared the statoreceptors firing rate and gain in marine Aplysia and freshwater Lymnaea and speculated that the difference in ecology of the animals leads to a more sensitive statocyst in Aplysia . For land snails vestibular function is important for gravitaxis reaction, when the animals climb to elevated positions for diurnal rest in hot and dry day-time, and when returning back to the soil at dusk (Cowie, 1985 ; Aubry et al., 2006 ; Di Lellis et al., 2012 ). Another obvious biological significance of statocyst function is its role in the withdrawal reaction, as a sudden change of the body position may preclude an attack of a predator. In agreement with ecology of land snails, our physiological data show that the Helix statocyst operates more for coding the orientation of animal's body than fast changes in its direction.","Author contributions Research concept and design: NA, AM, VI, IZ, RB, and PB.

Here we present an anatomical description of this structure in the adult oyster toadfish, and establish a morphological basis for interpretation of subsequent functional studies. Light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy techniques were applied to visualize the sensory epithelium at varying levels of detail, its neural innervation and its synaptic organization. Scanning electron microscopy was used to visualize otolith mass and morphological polarization patterns of hair cells. Afferent nerve fibers were visualized following labeling with biocytin, and light microscope images were used to make three-dimensional (3-D) reconstructions of individual labeled afferents to identify dendritic morphology with respect to epithelial location. Transmission electron micrographs were compiled to create a serial 3-D reconstruction of a labeled afferent over a segment of its dendritic field and to examine the cell-afferent synaptic contacts. Major observations are: a well-defined striola, medial and lateral extra-striolar regions with a zonal organization of hair bundles; prominent lacinia projecting laterally; dependence of hair cell density on macular location; narrow afferent dendritic fields that follow the hair bundle polarization; synaptic specializations issued by afferents are typically directed towards a limited number of 7–13 hair cells, but larger dendritic fields in the medial extra-striola can be associated with > 20 hair cells also; and hair cell synaptic bodies can be confined to only an individual afferent or can synapse upon several afferents.",,,,,,,"Morphology of the Utricular Otolith Organ in the Toadfish, Opsanus tau",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5899691/,

The utricular organ senses the sum of inertial force due to head translation and head tilt relative to gravitational vertical. Change in gravitational force would be expected to have profound effects on how an organism maintains equilibrium. We characterize the physiology of utricular afferents to applied accelerations in the oyster toadfish, Opsanus tau , in normal 1 g to establish benchmarks, after 1–32-day exposures to 2.24 g (resultant) via centrifugation (hypergravity, HG), after 4- and 16-day exposures to 1.12 g (resultant), and following 1–8 days recovery to HG exposures to study re-adaptation to 1 g. Afferents were also examined during activation of efferent vestibular pathway. Centrifugation at 2.24 g included 228°/s constant angular velocity component, and thus horizontal canal afferent responses to yaw rotation were recorded as an internal control in each fish. Afferents studied after 228°/s rotation for 4 and 16 days without centripetal acceleration, called On-Center-Control, were indistinguishable from their control counterparts. Principal response to HG was an adjustment of afferent sensitivity as a function of magnitude and duration of exposure: an initial robust increase at 3–4 days followed by a significant decrease from 16 to 32 days. Initial increase observed after 4 days of HG took >4 days in 1 g to recover, and the decrease observed after 16 days of HG took >2 days to readapt to 1 g. Hair cells in striola and medial extrastriola macula regions were serially reconstructed in 3D from thin sections using transmission electron microscopy in control fish and fish exposed to 4 and 16 days of HG. Despite the highly significant differences in afferent physiology, synaptic body counts quantified in the same fish were equivalent in their inter-animal variability and averages. No clear role of the efferent pathway as a feedback mechanism regulating afferent behavior to HG was found.

Here, we identify a link between the UPR and the phytohormone auxin, a master regulator of plant physiology. We show that ER stress triggers down-regulation of auxin sensors and transporters in Arabidopsis thaliana . We also demonstrate that an Arabidopsis mutant of a conserved ER stress sensor IRE1 exhibits defects in the auxin response and levels. These data not only support that the plant IRE1 is required for auxin homeostasis, they also reveal a species-specific feature of IRE1 in multicellular eukaryotes. Furthermore, by establishing that UPR activation is reduced in mutants of ER-localized auxin transporters, including PIN5, we define a long-neglected biological significance of ER-based auxin regulation. We further examine the functional relationship of IRE1 and PIN5 by showing that an ire1 pin5 triple mutant enhances defects of UPR activation and auxin homeostasis in ire1 or pin5 .

In order to protect the delicate protein folding process and ensure the proper cellular delivery of protein products under environmental stresses, eukaryotes have evolved a set of signaling mechanisms known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) to increase the folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum. This process is particularly important in plants, because their sessile nature commands adaptation for survival rather than escape from stress. As such, plants make special use of the UPR, and evidence indicates that the master regulators and downstream effectors of the UPR have distinct roles in mediating cellular processes that affect organism growth and development as well as stress responses.

The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca 2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump is responsible for bringing Ca 2+ from the cytosol into its storage site, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), at the expense of ATP. We have recently demonstrated that, in the soleus of space-flown mice, the Ca 2+ uptake ability of the SERCA pump is severely impaired and this may be attributed to increases in reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS), to which SERCA is highly susceptible. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether treatment with the antioxidant, Manganese(III) meso -tetrakis( N -n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE), could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction. We received soleus muscles from the rodent research 18 mission which had male mice housed on the international space station for 35 days and treated with either saline or BuOE. Spaceflight significantly reduced the soleus:body mass ratio and significantly increased SERCA’s ionophore ratio, a measure of SR Ca 2+ leak, and 4-HNE content (marker of RONS), none of which could be rescued by BuOE treatment.

Research supported by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) provided much of the early findings on identifying cellular pathways involved in radiation injuries, due to the need to push the boundaries to kill tumor cells while minimizing damage to intervening normal tissues. By protecting normal tissue surrounding the tumors, physicians can deliver a higher radiation dose to tumors and reduce adverse effects related to the treatment. Initially relying on this critical NCI research, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), first tasked with developing radiation medical countermeasures in 2004, has provided bridge funding to move basic research toward advanced development and translation. The goal of the NIAID program is to fund approaches that can one day be employed to protect civilian populations during a radiological or nuclear incident. In addition, with the reality of long-term space flights and the possibility of radiation exposures to both acute, high-intensity, and chronic lower-dose levels, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has identified requirements to discover and develop radioprotectors and mitigators to protect their astronauts during space missions.

To determine what host components are important for bacterial replication, we performed microarray analysis on Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells by comparing host gene transcript levels between permissive and nonpermissive conditions for E. chaffeensis growth. Five-hundred twenty-seven genes had increased transcript levels unique to permissive growth conditions 24 h postinfection. We screened adult flies that were mutants for several of the “permissive” genes for the ability to support Ehrlichia replication. Three additional D. melanogaster fly lines with putative mutations in pyrimidine metabolism were also tested. Ten fly lines carrying mutations in the genes CG6479 , separation anxiety , chitinase 11 , CG6364 ( Uck2 ), CG6543 ( Echs1 ), withered ( whd ), CG15881 ( Ccdc58 ), CG14806 ( Apop1 ), CG11875 ( Nup37 ), and dumpy ( dp ) had increased resistance to infection with Ehrlichia .

Pathologically, a significant elevation in pro-inflammatory cytokine production is associated with ASFV infection in pigs and there is high interest in identifying dual-acting natural compounds that exhibit antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities. Methods Using the laboratory-adapted ASFV BA71V strain, we screened a library of 297 natural, anti-inflammatory compounds to identify promising candidates that protected Vero cells against virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE). Virus yield reduction, virucidal, and cell cytotoxicity experiments were performed on positive hits and two lead compounds were further characterized in dose-dependent assays along with time-of-addition, time-of-removal, virus entry, and viral protein synthesis assays. The antiviral effects of the two lead compounds on mitigating virulent ASFV infection in porcine macrophages (PAMs) were also tested using similar methods, and the ability to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine production during virulent ASFV infection was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results The screen identified five compounds that inhibited ASFV-induced CPE by greater than 50% and virus yield reduction experiments showed that two of these compounds, tetrandrine and berbamine, exhibited particularly high levels of anti-ASFV activity. Mechanistic analysis confirmed that both compounds potently inhibited early stages of ASFV infection and that the compounds also inhibited infection of PAMs by the virulent ASFV Arm/07 isolate. Importantly, during ASFV infection in PAM cells, both compounds markedly reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in disease pathogenesis while tetrandrine had a greater and more sustained anti-inflammatory effect than berbamine. Conclusions Together, these findings support that dual-acting natural compounds with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties hold promise as preventative and therapeutic agents to combat ASFV infection by simultaneously inhibiting viral replication and reducing virus-induced cytokine production.

The pathogenesis of this AT inflammation, however, remains to be elucidated. The circulating adipokine leptin is increased in obesity and is involved in immune cell function and activation. In the present study, we investigated the role of leptin in the induction of obesity-associated inflammation. We generated radiation chimeric C57BL/6J mice reconstituted with either leptin receptor-deficient ( db / db ) or wild-type (WT) bone marrow and challenged them with a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. Mice reconstituted with db / db bone marrow (WT/db), had significantly lower body weight and adiposity compared with mice with WT bone marrow (WT/WT). Gonadal AT in WT/db mice displayed a 2-fold lower expression of the inflammatory genes Tnfa , Il6 , and Ccl2 . In addition, gonadal fat of WT/db mice contained significantly fewer crown-like structures compared with WT/WT mice, and most of their AT macrophages expressed macrophage galactose-type C type lectin 1 (MGL1) and were C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2)-negative, indicative of an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Moreover, WT/db mice exhibited greater insulin sensitivity compared with WT/WT mice. These data show that disrupted leptin signaling in bone marrow-derived cells attenuates the proinflammatory conditions that mediate many of the metabolic complications that characterize obesity.

To provide an in vitro tool to investigate the link between leptin and innate immunity, we immortalized and characterized a leptin receptor-deficient macrophage cell line, DB-1. The cell line was created using bone marrow cells from leptin receptor-deficient mice. Bone marrow cells were differentiated into macrophages by culturing them with recombinant mouse macrophage colony stimulating factor, and passaged when confluent for 6 months. The cells spontaneously immortalized at approximately passage 20. Cells were cloned twice by limiting dilution cloning prior to characterization. The macrophage cell line is diploid and grows at a linear rate for 4–5 days before reaching the growth plateau. The cells are MAC-2 and F4/80 positive and have phagocytic activity similar to primary macrophages from wild-type and leptin receptor-deficient mice. DB-1 cells were responsive to stimulation with interferon-γ as measured by increase in Nos2 transcript levels. In addition, DB-1 macrophages are not responsive to the chemotactic signaling of adipocyte conditioned media nor leptin when compared to primary WT macrophages.

We observed that P. aeruginosa grown during spaceflight exhibited increased final cell density relative to normal gravity controls when low concentrations of phosphate in the media were combined with decreased oxygen availability. In contrast, when the availability of either phosphate or oxygen was increased, no difference in final cell density was observed between spaceflight and normal gravity. Because motility has been suggested to affect how microbes respond to microgravity, we compared the growth of wild-type P. aeruginosa to a Δ motABCD mutant deficient in swimming motility. However, the final cell densities observed with the motility mutant were consistent with those observed with wild type for all conditions tested. Conclusions These results indicate that differences in bacterial final cell densities observed between spaceflight and normal gravity are due to an interplay between microgravity conditions and the availability of substrates essential for growth. Further, our results suggest that microbes grown under nutrient-limiting conditions are likely to reach higher cell densities under microgravity conditions than they would on Earth. Considering that the majority of bacteria inhabiting spacecrafts and space stations are likely to live under nutrient limitations, our findings highlight the need to explore the impact microgravity and other aspects of the spaceflight environment have on microbial growth and physiology.",,Methods,Results,Discussion,,Conclusions,Effect of spaceflight on Pseudomonas aeruginosa final cell density is modulated by nutrient and oxygen availability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4228280/,

Surface-associated bacterial communities, known as biofilms, were abundant on the Mir space station and continue to be a challenge on the International Space Station. The health and safety hazards linked to the development of biofilms are of particular concern due to the suppression of immune function observed during spaceflight. While planktonic cultures of microbes have indicated that spaceflight can lead to increases in growth and virulence, the effects of spaceflight on biofilm development and physiology remain unclear. To address this issue, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured during two Space Shuttle Atlantis missions: STS-132 and STS-135, and the biofilms formed during spaceflight were characterized. Spaceflight was observed to increase the number of viable cells, biofilm biomass, and thickness relative to normal gravity controls. Moreover, the biofilms formed during spaceflight exhibited a column-and-canopy structure that has not been observed on Earth. The increase in the amount of biofilms and the formation of the novel architecture during spaceflight were observed to be independent of carbon source and phosphate concentrations in the media. However, flagella-driven motility was shown to be essential for the formation of this biofilm architecture during spaceflight. These findings represent the first evidence that spaceflight affects community-level behaviors of bacteria and highlight the importance of understanding how both harmful and beneficial human-microbe interactions may be altered during spaceflight.",Introduction,Materials and Methods,Results,Discussion,"Discussion We have shown that P. aeruginosa forms column-and-canopy-shaped biofilms during spaceflight and that flagella-driven motility plays a key role in the formation of this unique structure. Figure 4 summarizes how biofilms formed under the spaceflight culture conditions compare with those formed under two common laboratory culture conditions, static and hydrodynamic [26] , [30] . Under hydrodynamic conditions, P. aeruginosa can form mushroom-shaped structured biofilms, while flat biofilms are generally observed under static conditions [23] . Under static conditions during spaceflight, however, biofilms with column-and-canopy structures were observed. Flagella-driven motility plays a key role the formation of column-and-canopy-shaped biofilms formed during spaceflight and the mushroom-shaped biofilms formed in hydrodynamic conditions on Earth. However, the formation of mushroom-shaped biofilms is dependent on a carbon source [31] , while we have observed that the formation of column-and-canopy-shaped biofilms is independent of carbon source ( Figures 2 and S4 ). Both the column-and-canopy-shaped biofilms and the mushroom-shaped biofilms have two-layered structures, and the mushroom “stalks"" and columns are likely formed using the same mechanism, further evidenced by the fact that flagella-driven motility is required for both. While the top layer of the mushroom-shaped biofilms is an isolated cap structure, the top layer of the column-and-canopy-shaped biofilms is a flat mat-like structure. The canopy is likely an extension and connection of the isolated “caps” observed in mushroom-shaped structures ( Figure 4 ). While still an active area of research, the size of mushroom “cap” has been observed to be limited under hydrodynamic conditions in normal gravity by a combination of flow [32] , gravity or natural dispersal mechanisms [5] . In contrast, the fluid dynamics surrounding cells in microgravity are extremely quiescent because of diminished gravity (∼10 −6 g) [33] , [34] . Under microgravity conditions, the virtual absence of flow and gravity may promote the unlimited expansion of the mushroom “caps” resulting in the formation of the intact canopy on top of the relatively widely spaced columns. The formation of flat biofilms with the GE inserts may be due an increase in biofilm growth rate, either by preventing the formation of the stratified structure or expanding into the space available under the canopy. However, it is possible that increased oxygen availability inhibits the formation of the column-and-canopy structure. 10.1371/journal.pone.0062437.g004 Figure 4 Illustration summarizing the influence of gravity, flow, and motility on P.aeruginosa biofilm architecture. We speculate that the increases in biofilm formation observed with the GE inserts are primarily due to increased oxygen availability. With the solid inserts, the conditions in the FPA are most likely microaerophilic to anaerobic as the cells consume the oxygen available in the liquid and air bubble present in the closed system. While the GE inserts were designed to provide an aerobic environment in the FPAs, results from P. aeruginosa gene expression studies have indicated that growth is likely oxygen limited even with the GE inserts and that differences in oxygen gradients within the FPAs likely exist between normal gravity and spaceflight conditions [16] . In the present study, the direct attachment of the biofilm substrate to the GE inserts maximized the oxygen available for surface-associated cells and minimized the differences in oxygen availability between spaceflight and normal gravity conditions. Overall, in the samples grown with the solid inserts, oxygen is likely a limiting substrate for growth. When the GE inserts were used to increase the oxygen availability, an increase in biofilm was observed and the difference between normal gravity and microgravity diminished. Therefore, the advantage conferred by microgravity is dependent upon resource availability, where changes in mixing, diffusion, sedimentation and other environmental factors play a more significant role under such limiting conditions. This observation is similar to results from Wilson et al. , who showed that an increase in nutrient availability minimized the differences in virulence observed with Salmonella between normal and microgravity [22] . We anticipate that these data will lead to the development of mathematical models describing the physico-chemical environment experienced by the cells under microgravity and normal gravity conditions and insights into the nature of the differences that cause the observed changes in growth and dependence on nutrient availability. We have demonstrated that spaceflight can trigger changes in P. aeruginosa biofilm growth and architecture. To the best of our knowledge, these findings are the first evidence that spaceflight influences community-level behaviors of bacteria. Our findings indicate that altered biofilm formation during spaceflight may have detrimental impacts on long-term spaceflight missions, where increases in biofouling and microbially-induced corrosion could have profound impacts on mission success. Furthermore, it will be important to explore the effects of such changes on human health through pathogenic and beneficial interactions between humans and microbes during spaceflight. While further studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the formation of the unique biofilm architecture observed during spaceflight, this work provides a set of data exploring conditions and parameters that are not possible on Earth. Thus, furthering our understanding of how environmental parameters alter biofilm formation by this key opportunistic pathogen. The unique morphology of the P. aeruginosa biofilms formed in microgravity suggests that nature is capable of adapting to non-terrestrial environments in ways that deserve further studies, including those exploring long-term growth and adaptation to a low gravity environment.","Supporting Information Figure S1 Specialized hardware for spaceflight experiments.

While lymphatic capillary structure suggests that passive, paracellular transport would be the predominate route of macromolecule entry, active caveolae-mediated transcellular transport has been identified in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in vitro. Caveolae also mediate a wide array of endothelial cell processes, including nitric oxide regulation. Thus, how does the lack of caveolae impact “lymphatic function”? Methods: Various aspects of lymphatic transport were measured in mice constitutively lacking caveolin-1 (“CavKO”), the protein required for caveolae formation in endothelial cells, and in mice with a LEC-specific Cav1 gene deletion (Lyve1-Cre x Cav1 flox/flox ; “LyCav”) and ex vivo in their vessels and cells. Results: In each model, lymphatic architecture was largely unchanged. The lymphatic conductance, or initial tissue uptake, was significantly higher in both CavKO mice and LyCav mice by quantitative microlymphangiography and the permeability to 70kDa dextran was significantly increased in monolayers of LECs isolated from CavKO mice. Conversely, transport within the lymphatic system to the sentinel node was significantly reduced in anesthetized CavKO and LyCav mice. Isolated, cannulated collecting vessel studies identified significantly reduced phasic contractility when lymphatic endothelium lacks caveolae. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase was able to partially restore ex vivo vessel contractility. Conclusion: Macromolecule transport across lymphatics is increased with loss of caveolae, yet phasic contractility reduced, resulting in reduced overall lymphatic transport function.

Fungal concentrations ranged from an average of 4.4 × 10 6 spore equivalents per milligram of dust in original dust with no exposure to relative humidity to up to 2.1 × 10 10 when exposed to 100% relative humidity for 2 weeks. As relative humidity and time-elevated increased, fungal diversity was significantly reduced for both alpha ( Q < 0.05) and beta ( R 2 = 0.307, P = 0.001) diversity metrics. Bacteria were unable to be modeled using the time-of-wetness framework. However, bacterial communities did change based on constant relative humidity incubations for both beta ( R 2 = 0.22, P = 0.001) and alpha diversity decreasing with increasing moisture starting at 85% relative humidity ( Q < 0.05). Conclusion Our results demonstrate that moisture conditions can be used to develop and predict changes in fungal growth and composition onboard human-occupied spacecraft. This predictive model can be expanded upon to include other spacecraft environmental factors such as microgravity, elevated carbon dioxide conditions, and radiation exposure. Understanding microbial growth in spacecraft can help better protect astronaut health, fortify spacecraft integrity, and promote planetary protection as human activity increases in low-Earth orbit, the moon, Mars, and beyond.

The purpose of the study was to determine whether putative modifications in endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the femur are associated with changes in trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) with altered estrogen status in young (6 mon) and old (24 mon) female Fischer-344 rats. Animals were divided into 6 groups: 1) young intact, 2) old intact, 3) young ovariectomized (OVX), 4) old OVX, 5) young OVX plus estrogen replacement (OVX+E2), and 6) old OVX+E2. PNA endothelium-dependent vasodilation was assessed in vitro using acetylcholine. Trabecular bone volume of the distal femoral metaphysis was determined by microCT. In young rats, vasodilation was diminished by OVX and restored with estrogen replacement (intact, 82±7; OVX, 61±9; OVX+E2, 90±4%), which corresponded with similar modifications in BV/TV (intact, 28.7±1.6; OVX, 16.3±0.9; OVX+E2, 25.7±1.4%). In old animals, vasodilation was unaffected by OVX but enhanced with estrogen replacement (intact, 55±8; OVX, 59±7; OVX+E2, 92±4%). Likewise, modifications in BV/TV followed the same pattern (intact, 33.1±1.6; OVX, 34.4±3.7; OVX+E2, 42.4±2.1%). Furthermore, in old animals with low endogenous estrogen (i.e., intact and old OVX), vasodilation was correlated with BV/TV (R 2 = 0.630; P<0.001). These data demonstrate parallel effects of estrogen on vascular endothelial function and BV/TV, and provide for a possible coupling mechanism linking endothelium-dependent vasodilation to bone remodeling.",Introduction,Materials and Methods,Results,Discussion,"Discussion The purpose of this study was to determine whether estrogen status affects endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the femoral diaphyseal principal nutrient artery, and whether these putative changes in vascular endothelial function are associated with alterations in trabecular bone volume. In young rats, the results demonstrate that lowering circulating estrogen through ovariectomy impairs endothelium-dependent vasodilation ( Fig. 2A ) and diminishes trabecular bone volume in the femur ( Fig. 2B ), whereas replacement of estrogen following ovariectomy maintains both endothelium-mediated vasodilation and trabecular bone volume. In old rats, ovariectomy had no effect on circulating estrogen levels, endothelium-dependent vasodilation ( Fig. 3A ) or trabecular bone volume ( Fig. 3B ). However, the addition of exogenous estrogen following ovariectomy elevated endothelium-dependent vasodilation ( Fig. 3A ) and increased bone volume ( Fig. 3B ). The estrogen-induced alterations in endothelium-mediated vasodilation were strongly correlated with changes in trabecular bone volume in both young ( Fig. 2C ) and old ( Fig. 3C ) rats. To our knowledge, these are the first data to report the effects of ovariectomy and estrogen replacement on endothelium-dependent vasodilation in bone from young and old animals, and the first to examine the relation between vascular function and bone properties with age and estrogen status as variables. It has long been appreciated that estrogen can have positive effects on the skeletal system. For example, during adolescent growth estrogen is the critical reproductive factor for both girls and boys [31] . Additionally, a fall in estrogen concentration below 30 pg/mL during menopause corresponds to the period of accelerated bone loss [31] . The loss of estrogen following menopause creates an imbalance between bone resorption and formation that leads to a net loss of bone [32] . Many postmenopausal women exhibit reduced bone mass as well as high-turnover bone metabolism, and the reversal of these conditions are observed following estrogen replacement [33] . The preservation of bone mass during this period requires exogenous administration of estrogen sufficient to raise plasma concentrations to 50 pg/mL [31] . Estrogen receptors are present on osteoblasts [34] , [35] , but the actions of estrogen on these cells and osteoblast-like cells have been variable [4] . A recent study suggests that the mechanism(s) of action of estrogen on bone cell activity is related to the control of function and lifespan of osteoclasts, which serves to ultimately minimize bone resorption [33] . The exact mechanism(s) through which estrogen acts to modulate bone cell activity is not completely understood, allowing for the possibility that non-skeletal tissue may act to modulate bone cell activity [31] . We hypothesize that one such mechanism is related to bone vascular endothelial function and its ability to 1) directly influence bone cell activity through local release of endothelium-derived signaling molecules such as NO and PGI 2 [36] , [37] , and 2) to regulate skeletal perfusion, which could indirectly affect bone cell activity through its impact on fluid filtration out of the vascular compartment and, correspondingly, interstitial fluid pressure in bone [13] , [37] – [40] . There is a growing body of literature that supports the notion that the bone vasculature can modulate bone cell activity [40] – [42] . In regard to old age-related bone loss, previous studies in humans and animals have shown compromised bone and marrow blood flow are associated with osteopenia [18] – [22] and studies in male rats have shown impaired bone vascular endothelial function is related to old age-induced bone loss [21] , [22] . Additionally, a recent study has reported that a program of low-intensity endurance exercise training that elicits low mechanical strain on bone restores endothelial NO-mediated vasodilation of the PNA and increases trabecular bone volume and mineral density in the distal femur of old male rats [21] . The results demonstrated that old age-induced decrements and training-induced enhancement of NO-mediated vasodilation of the bone vasculature are positively correlated with changes in the bone properties [21] , [22] . Results from the present study also demonstrate an association between NO-mediated vasodilation of bone arteries and trabecular bone volume when estrogen status is altered through ovariectomy and estrogen replacement ( Fig. 2C and 3C ). Although these findings are consistent with the general hypothesis that bone vascular endothelial function is coupled to bone remodeling activity, these results alone are inconclusive since estrogen may have direct effects on both the bone vasculature and bone cell activity, which could be independent of each other. Therefore, we sought to determine whether a relation exists between vascular endothelial function and bone volume in animals where estrogen concentration was low, i.e., the young OVX and the old intact and OVX groups. Regression analyses indicated that there were no relations (P>0.05) between trabecular bone volume and plasma estrogen ( Figs. 5A and 6A ) or uterine mass ( Figs. 5B and 6B ), a biomarker for reproductive hormone status, indicating that the direct effects of estrogen on cancellous bone volume are negligible in these low-estrogen groups. However, there was a significant association between peak endothelium-dependent vasodilation and trabecular bone volume ( Figs. 5C and 6C ) in the femur. These findings provide support for the concept of a vascular coupling mechanism in bone. This conclusion of a coupling mechanism between the bone vasculature and bone mass is further supported by two studies in humans, where forearm conduit artery endothelial vasodilator responsiveness, used as a surrogate measure of bone endothelial function, was positively correlated with lumbar spine bone mineral density in postmenopausal women [43] , [44] . Thus, in groups without the potentially confounding influence of estrogen, the relation between endothelial function and bone mass is still evident. Intact young and old female rats regulate vasodilation of the femoral PNA primarily through a NOS signaling mechanism and to a lesser extent through a COX signaling pathway ( Fig. 1A ). These regulatory mechanisms are similar to those of male animals, whereby endothelium-dependent vasodilation is mediated predominantly via the NOS signaling cascade [21] , [22] . The old age-associated decrement in endothelium-dependent vasodilation in female rats results from declines in NO-mediated regulation, which is also similar to that observed in male rats. In the absence of estrogen (OVX group), vasodilation in the presence of L-NAME alone is eliminated ( Fig. 1B ). Interestingly, with estrogen replacement the regulating vasodilator mechanism shifts from the primarily NO signaling pathway to one that includes NO and the putative endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor, as indicated by the significant vasodilation that occurs in estrogen replete rats when both NOS and COX signaling pathways are blocked ( Fig. 1C ). Therefore, the addition of estrogen from an exogenous source does not simply restore the regulatory mechanisms for vasodilation but alters the signaling mechanisms through which the peak endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the bone resistance vasculature is achieved. A shift in the mechanism of endothelium-dependent vasodilation with OVX has also been reported in mesenteric arteries. In intact rats, endothelium-dependent vasodilation of mesenteric arteries is mediated through both the NOS and COX signaling pathways; OVX diminished the NO-mediated component and augmented the contribution of the COX signaling pathway [45] . The decrement in endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral PNA with OVX in young rats has also been reported to occur in other vascular beds. For example, OVX has been shown to depress endothelium-dependent vasodilation of pulmonary arteries [46] , the thoracic aorta [46] , and coronary resistance arteries [26] in young rats. However, several studies examining the effects of OVX on endothelium-dependent vasodilation in bone arteries of young animals have reported results that are dissimilar to those of the present investigation. In the first study, arterial segments from rabbits were isolated from the metaphyseal cancellous bone and the diaphyseal bone marrow of the femur six weeks after OVX [47] . The vessel segments with a diameter of ∼250 µm were cut into rings and two 40 µm diameter steel wires were passed through the lumen of the vessel rings. Changes in isometric force were measured with increasing concentrations of ACh after the arterial rings were preconstricted with norepinephrine. The results indicated that OVX did not alter endothelium-dependent relaxation [47] . The disparity of results compared to the current study could be due to several factors, including differences in 1) the animal species studied and 2) the techniques employed to study the vascular responses. For instance, unlike rats and humans, rabbits do not undergo the various stages of the estrous cycle [48] . Also, the wire myograph technique used is not ideal for determination of endothelium-dependent vasodilation in small diameter vessels because of the potential for the wires to damage endothelial cells as they are passed through the lumen of the vessel rings. The second study with disparate results relative to those of the current study investigated the effects of OVX in medullary arterioles from the femur of rats using the pressurized vessel technique [49] . Vasodilation induced by ACh was not different between medullary arterioles from intact and OVX rats. The discrepancy in findings may result from differences in the strain of rat studied (Fischer-344 vs. Sprague Dawley), age of the animals at sacrifice (6 and 24 months vs. 3 to 3 ½ months) and, most probably, differences in the period of OVX (2 months vs. 7–10 days). Few studies have examined the effects of OVX on endothelium-dependent vasodilation with advanced age. Castillo et al. [50] reported that relaxation of aortic rings to ACh was reduced in 20-month-old OVX rats. In contrast, OVX had no further effect to depress endothelium-dependent vasodilation of coronary resistance arteries [26] and femoral PNAs (present study) from old rats. These results indicate that the old age-associated decline in circulating estrogen may contribute to the overall reduction in endothelial cell vasodilator responsiveness that occurs with advancing age [21] , [22] , [27] , [29] . The lack of bone loss with ovariectomy in the aged animals was counterintuitive to anticipated results and other published reports. For example, ovariectomy in rats 18 months of age has shown volume decrements in long bones as well as the vertebrae [51] – [53] . However, to our knowledge, there are no published reports on bone responses to ovariectomy utilizing rats of such an advanced age (i.e., 24 months) as the current investigation. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrate that lowering circulating estrogen through ovariectomy impairs endothelium-dependent vasodilation ( Fig. 2A ) and diminishes trabecular bone volume ( Fig. 2B ) in the femur of young, but not in old female rats ( Figs. 3A and 3B ). Estrogen replacement following ovariectomy maintains and enhances both endothelium-mediated vasodilation and trabecular bone volume in young and old animals, respectively. The estrogen-induced alterations in endothelium-mediated vasodilation were strongly correlated with changes in trabecular bone volume in both young ( Fig. 2C ) and old ( Fig. 3C ) rats, indicating a possible coupling mechanism between the vascular endothelium and bone remodeling activity. Unfortunately, these results alone are inconclusive due to the fact that estrogen may have direct effects on both the bone vasculature and bone cell activity that are independent of each other. However, in young OVX and old intact and OVX animals, where circulating estrogen levels are low with negligible effects on cancellous bone volume ( Figs. 5A, 5B , 6A and 6B ), regression analysis demonstrated a significant relation between peak endothelium-dependent vasodilation and trabecular bone volume ( Figs. 5C and 6C ) in the femur.

The purpose of the present investigation was to determine 1) whether 7 and 14 days of skeletal unloading alters femoral bone and marrow blood flow and vascular resistance during reloading, and 2) whether putative changes in bone perfusion are associated with a gross structural remodeling of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the femur. Six-month old male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to 7-d or 14-d hindlimb unloading (HU) or weight-bearing control groups. Bone perfusion was measured following 10 min of standing (reloading) following the unloading treatment. Histomorphometry was used to determine PNA media wall thickness and maximal diameter. Bone blood flow, arterial pressure and PNA structural characteristics were used to calculate arterial shear stress and circumferential wall stress. During reloading, femoral perfusion was lower in the distal metaphyseal region of 7-d HU rats, and in the proximal and distal metaphyses, diaphysis and diaphyseal marrow of 14-d HU animals relative to that in control rats. Vascular resistance was also higher in all regions of the femur in 14-d HU rats during reloading relative to control animals. Intraluminal diameter of PNAs from 14-d HU rats (138 ± 5 μm) was smaller than that of control PNAs (162 ± 6 μm), and medial wall thickness was thinner in PNAs from 14-d HU (14.3 ± 0.6 μm) versus that of control (18.0 ± 0.8 μm) rats. Decreases in both shear stress and circumferential stress occurred in the PNA with HU that later returned to control levels with the reductions in PNA maximal diameter and wall thickness, respectively. The results demonstrate that chronic skeletal unloading attenuates the ability to increase blood flow and nutrient delivery to bone and marrow with immediate acute reloading due, in part, to a remodeling of the bone resistance vasculature.",,,,,,,Chronic skeletal unloading of the rat femur: mechanisms and functional consequences of vascular remodeling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3856860/,

During exercise, an old age-associated inability to increase vascular resistance within the intra-abdominal AT may compromise the ability of the cardiovascular system to redistribute blood flow to the active musculature, contributing to the decline in exercise capacity observed in this population. We tested the hypotheses that 1 ) there would be an elevated perfusion of AT during exercise with old age that was associated with diminished vasoconstrictor responses of adipose-resistance arteries, and 2 ) chronic exercise training would mitigate the age-associated alterations in AT blood flow and vascular function. Young (6 mo; n = 40) and old (24 mo; n = 28) male Fischer 344 rats were divided into young sedentary (YSed), old sedentary (OSed), young exercise trained (YET), or old exercise trained (OET) groups, where training consisted of 10-12 wk of treadmill exercise. In vivo blood flow at rest and during exercise and in vitro α-adrenergic and myogenic vasoconstrictor responses in resistance arteries from AT were measured in all groups. In response to exercise, there was a directionally opposite change in AT blood flow in the OSed group (∼150% increase) and YSed (∼55% decrease) vs. resting values. Both α-adrenergic and myogenic vasoconstriction were diminished in OSed vs. YSed AT-resistance arteries. Exercise training resulted in a similar AT hyperemic response between age groups during exercise (YET, 9.9 ± 0.5 ml·min −1 ·100 −1 g; OET, 8.1 ± 0.9 ml·min −1 ·100 −1 g) and was associated with enhanced myogenic and α-adrenergic vasoconstriction of AT-resistance arteries from the OET group relative to OSed. These results indicate that there is an inability to increase vascular resistance in AT during exercise with old age, due, in part, to a diminished vasoconstriction of AT arteries. Furthermore, the results indicate that exercise training can augment vasoconstriction of AT arteries and mitigate age-related alterations in the regulation of AT blood flow during exercise.",,,,,,,Differential effects of aging and exercise on intra-abdominal adipose arteriolar function and blood flow regulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3615599/,

The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether mortality rates due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, accidents and all other causes of death differ in (1) astronauts who never flew orbital missions in space, (2) astronauts who flew only in low Earth orbit (LEO), and (3) Apollo lunar astronauts, the only humans to have traveled beyond Earth’s magnetosphere. Results show there were no differences in CVD mortality rate between non-flight (9%) and LEO (11%) astronauts. However, the CVD mortality rate among Apollo lunar astronauts (43%) was 4–5 times higher than in non-flight and LEO astronauts. To test a possible mechanistic basis for these findings, a secondary purpose was to determine the long-term effects of simulated weightlessness and space-relevant total-body irradiation on vascular responsiveness in mice. The results demonstrate that space-relevant irradiation induces a sustained vascular endothelial cell dysfunction. Such impairment is known to lead to occlusive artery disease, and may be an important risk factor for CVD among astronauts exposed to deep space radiation.",,Methods,Results,Discussion,,,Apollo Lunar Astronauts Show Higher Cardiovascular Disease Mortality: Possible Deep Space Radiation Effects on the Vascular Endothelium,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4964660/,

Coronary microvascular resistance is directly dependent on vascular smooth muscle function in coronary resistance arterioles; therefore, we hypothesized that age impairs contractile function and alters the phenotype of vascular smooth muscle in coronary arterioles. We further hypothesized that exercise training restores contractile function and reverses age-induced phenotypic alterations of arteriolar smooth muscle. Young and old Fischer 344 rats underwent 10 wk of treadmill exercise training or remained sedentary. At the end of training or cage confinement, contractile responses, vascular smooth muscle proliferation, and expression of contractile proteins were assessed in isolated coronary arterioles. Both receptor- and non-receptor-mediated contractile function were impaired in coronary arterioles from aged rats. Vascular smooth muscle shifted from a differentiated, contractile phenotype to a secretory phenotype with associated proliferation of smooth muscle in the arteriolar wall. Expression of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain 1 (SM1) was decreased in arterioles from aged rats, whereas expression of phospho-histone H3 and of the synthetic protein ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) were increased. Exercise training improved contractile responses, reduced smooth muscle proliferation and expression of rpS6, and increased expression of SM1 in arterioles from old rats. Thus age-induced contractile dysfunction of coronary arterioles and emergence of a secretory smooth muscle phenotype may contribute to impaired coronary blood flow responses, but arteriolar contractile responsiveness and a younger smooth muscle phenotype can be restored with late-life exercise training. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Aging impairs contractile function of coronary arterioles and induces a shift of the vascular smooth muscle toward a proliferative, noncontractile phenotype. Late-life exercise training reverses contractile dysfunction of coronary arterioles and restores a young phenotype to the vascular smooth muscle.",,,,,,,Effects of age and exercise training on coronary microvascular smooth muscle phenotype and function,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5866446/,

To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles and oxidative stress-associated apoptosis were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Nine-week-old male C57BL/6 mice ( n = 12) were launched from the Kennedy Space Center on a SpaceX rocket to the ISS for a 35-day mission. The animals were housed in the mouse Habitat Cage Unit (HCU) in the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) “Kibo” facility on the ISS. The flight mice lived either under an ambient microgravity condition (µg) or in a centrifugal habitat unit that produced 1 g artificial gravity (µg + 1 g ). Habitat control (HC) and vivarium control mice lived on Earth in HCUs or normal vivarium cages, respectively. Quantitative assessment of ocular tissue demonstrated that the µg group induced significant apoptosis in the retina vascular endothelial cells compared to all other groups ( p < 0.05) that was 64% greater than that in the HC group. Proteomic analysis showed that many key pathways responsible for cell death, cell repair, inflammation, and metabolic stress were significantly altered in µg mice compared to HC animals. Additionally, there were more significant changes in regulated protein expression in the µg group relative to that in the µg + 1 g group. These data provide evidence that spaceflight induces retinal apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells and changes in retinal protein expression related to cellular structure, immune response and metabolic function, and that artificial gravity (AG) provides some protection against these changes.

This study tested the hypothesis that hindlimb unloading (HU) exerts diverse effects on forelimb and hindlimb small arteries of rats in functionally different regions of the skeletal muscle and skin. Methods : Male Wistar rats were subjected to HU for 2 weeks, then skeletal muscle arteries (deep brachial and sural) and skin arteries (median and saphenous) were examined in vitro using wire myography or isobaric perfusion and glyoxylic acid staining. Results : HU increased lumen diameter of both forelimb arteries but decreased diameter of the sural artery; the saphenous artery diameter was not affected. Following HU, maximal contractile responses to noradrenaline and serotonin increased in the forelimb but decreased in the hindlimb skeletal muscle feed arteries with no change in skin arteries; all region-specific alterations persisted after endothelium removal. HU increased the sensitivity to vasoconstrictors in the saphenous artery but not in the sural artery. In the saphenous artery, initially high sympathetic innervation density was reduced by HU, sparse innervation in the sural artery was not affected. Electrical stimulation of periarterial sympathetic nerves in isobarically perfused segments of the saphenous artery demonstrated a two-fold decrease of the contractile responses in HU rats compared to that of controls. Conclusion : HU induces contrasting structural and functional adaptations in forelimb and hindlimb skeletal muscle arteries. Additionally, HU had diverse effects in two hindlimb vascular regions. Hyper-sensitivity of the saphenous artery to vasoconstrictors appears to result from the shortage of trophic sympathetic influence. Importantly, HU impaired sympathetically induced arterial vasoconstriction, consistent with the decreased sympathetic constrictor response in humans following space flight.",Introduction,Materials and Methods,Results,Discussion,,Conclusion,Simulated microgravity induces regionally distinct neurovascular and structural remodeling of skeletal muscle and cutaneous arteries in the rat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7339929/,

The otolith maculae epithelial areas increased exponentially throughout embryonic development reaching asymptotic values near post-hatch day P7. Increases in hair cell density were dependent upon macular location; striolar hair cells developed first followed by hair cells in extrastriola regions. Stereocilia polarization was initiated early, with defining reversal zones forming at E8. Less than half of all immature hair cells observed had non-polarized internal kinocilia with the remaining exhibiting planar polarity. Immunohistochemistry and neural tracing techniques were employed to examine the shape and location of the striolar regions. Initial innervation of the maculae was by small fibers with terminal growth cones at E6, followed by collateral branches with apparent bouton terminals at E8.

In these bony structures, a pathological decrease in OPG expression stimulates osteoclast differentiation and excessive resorption followed by accrual of sclerotic bone, ultimately resulting in the development of otosclerosis, a leading cause of deafness in adults. Understanding the signaling pathways involved in maintaining OPG expression in the ear would shed light on the pathophysiology of otosclerosis and other ear bone-related diseases. We and others previously demonstrated that Ca 2+ signaling through the L-type Ca V 1.2 Ca 2+ channel positively regulates OPG expression and secretion in long bone osteoblasts and their precursor cells in vitro and in vivo. Whether Ca V 1.2 regulates OPG expression in ear bones has not been investigated. We drove expression of a gain-of-function Ca V 1.2 mutant channel (Ca V 1.2 TS ) using Col2a1-Cre, which we found to target osteochondral/osteoblast progenitors in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule. Col2a1-Cre;Ca V 1.2 TS mice displayed osteopetrosis of these bones shown by μCT 3D reconstruction, histological analysis, and lack of bone sculpting, findings similar to phenotypes seen in mice with an osteoclast defect. Consistent with those observations, we found that Col2a1-Cre;Ca V 1.2 TS mutant mice showed reduced osteoclasts in the otic capsule, upregulated mRNA expression of Opg and Opg/Rankl ratio, and increased mRNA expression of osteoblast differentiation marker genes in the otic capsule, suggesting both an anti-catabolic and anabolic effect of Ca V 1.2 TS mutant channel contributed to the observed morphological changes of the ear bones. Further, we found that Col2a1-Cre;Ca V 1.2 TS mice experienced hearing loss and displayed defects of body balance in behavior tests, confirming that the Ca V 1.2-dependent Ca 2+ influx affects bone structure in the ear and consequent hearing and vestibular functions. Together, these data support our hypothesis that Ca 2+ influx through Ca V 1.2 TS promotes OPG expression from osteoblasts, thereby affecting bone modeling/remodeling in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule.

Plants on orbit, growing in the absence of any physical reference to the terrestrial gravity vector, displayed typically “vertical” distribution of auxin in the primary root. This confirms that the establishment of the auxin-gradient system, the primary guide for gravity signaling in the root, is gravity independent. The cytokinin distribution in the root tip differs between spaceflight and the ground controls, suggesting spaceflight-induced features of root growth may be cytokinin related.

Comparing the gene expression profiles of WS and Col-0 in different tilted growth conditions identified 11 candidate genes as potentially involved in the control of skewing. These 11 genes are involved in several different cellular processes, including sugar transport, salt signaling, cell wall organization, and hormone signaling. Conclusions This study identified 11 genes whose change in expression level is associated with root skewing behavior. These genes are involved in signaling and perception, rather than the physical restructuring of root. Future work is needed to elucidate the potential role of these candidate genes during root skewing.

Genes that are important in establishing the spaceflight responses are being identified, their roles in spaceflight physiological adaptation are increasingly understood, and the fact that different genotypes adapt differently is recognized. However, the basic question of whether these spaceflight responses are actually required for survival has yet to be posed, and the fundamental notion that spaceflight responses may be non-adaptive has yet to be explored. Therefore the experiments presented here were designed to ask if portions of the plant spaceflight response can be genetically removed without causing loss of spaceflight survival and without causing increased stress responses. The CARA experiment compared the spaceflight transcriptome responses in the root tips of two Arabidopsis ecotypes, Col-0 and WS, as well as that of a PhyD mutant of Col-0. When grown with the ambient light of the ISS, phyD plants displayed a significantly reduced spaceflight transcriptome response compared to Col-0, suggesting that altering the activity of a single gene can actually improve spaceflight adaptation by reducing the transcriptome cost of physiological adaptation. The WS genotype showed an even simpler spaceflight transcriptome response in the ambient light of the ISS, more broadly indicating that the plant genotype can be manipulated to reduce the cost of spaceflight adaptation, as measured by transcriptional response. These differential genotypic responses suggest that genetic manipulation could further reduce, or perhaps eliminate the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation. When plants were germinated and then left in the dark on the ISS, the WS genotype actually mounted a larger transcriptome response than Col-0, suggesting that the in-space light environment affects physiological adaptation, which implies that manipulating the local habitat can also substantially impact the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation.",Introduction,Materials and methods,Results,Discussion,,Conclusions,Genetic dissection of the Arabidopsis spaceflight transcriptome: Are some responses dispensable for the physiological adaptation of plants to spaceflight?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5491145/,

The feasibility of using tiny root sections for transcriptome analysis was examined, comparing RNA sequencing ( RNA ‐Seq) to microarrays in characterizing genes that are relevant to spaceflight. Methods Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia ecotype (Col‐0) roots were sectioned into Zone 1 (0.5 mm; root cap and meristematic zone) and Zone 2 (1.5 mm; transition, elongation, and growth‐terminating zone). Differential gene expression in each was compared. Results Both microarrays and RNA ‐Seq proved applicable to the small samples. A total of 4180 genes were differentially expressed (with fold changes of 2 or greater) between Zone 1 and Zone 2. In addition, 771 unique genes and 19 novel transcriptionally active regions were identified by RNA ‐Seq that were not detected in microarrays. However, microarrays detected spaceflight‐relevant genes that were missed in RNA ‐Seq. Discussion Single root tip subsections can be used for transcriptome analysis using either RNA ‐Seq or microarrays. Both RNA ‐Seq and microarrays provided novel information.

The purpose of the facility is to enable multidisciplinary research on topics related to future plant cultivation on human space exploration missions. Research on food quality and safety, plant health monitoring, microbiology, system validation, human factors and horticultural sciences was conducted. Part of the latter is the determination of the biomass production of the different crops. The data on this topic is presented in this paper. During the first season 26 different crops were grown on the 12.5 m 2 cultivation area of the greenhouse. A large number of crops were grown continuously throughout the 9 months of operation, but there were also crops that were only grown a few times for test purposes. The focus of this season was on growing lettuce, leafy greens and fresh vegetables. In total more than 268 kg of edible biomass was produced by the EDEN ISS greenhouse facility in 2018. Most of the harvest was cucumbers (67 kg), lettuces (56 kg), leafy greens (49 kg), and tomatoes (50 kg) complemented with smaller amounts of herbs (12 kg), radish (8 kg), and kohlrabi (19 kg). The environmental set points for the crops were 330–600 μmol/(m 2* s) LED light, 21°C, ∼65% relative humidity, 1000 ppm and the photoperiod was 17 h per day.

Further, spaceflight root skewing suggests that specific root morphologies and cell wall remodeling systems may be important aspects of spaceflight physiological adaptation. However, connections between skewing, cell wall modification and spaceflight physiology are currently based on inferences rather than direct tests. Therefore, the Advanced Plant Experiments-03-2 (APEX-03-2) spaceflight study was designed to elucidate the contribution of two skewing- and cell wall-associated genes in Arabidopsis to root behavior and gene expression patterns in spaceflight, to assess whether interruptions of different skewing pathways affect the overall spaceflight-associated process. SPIRAL1 is a skewing-related protein implicated in directional cell expansion, and functions by regulating cortical microtubule dynamics. SKU5 is skewing-related glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein of the plasma membrane and cell wall implicated in stress response signaling. These two genes function in different cellular pathways that affect skewing on the Earth, and enable a test of the relevance of skewing pathways to spaceflight physiological adaptation. In this study, both sku5 and spr1 mutants showed different skewing behavior and markedly different patterns of gene expression in the spaceflight environment. The spr1 mutant showed fewer differentially expressed genes than its Col-0 wild-type, whereas sku5 showed considerably more than its WS wild-type. Developmental age played a substantial role in spaceflight acclimation in all genotypes, but particularly in sku5 plants, where spaceflight 4d seedlings had almost 10-times as many highly differentially expressed genes as the 8d seedlings. These differences demonstrated that the two skewing pathways represented by SKU5 and SPR1 have unique and opposite contributions to physiological adaptation to spaceflight. The spr1 response is less intense than wild type, suggesting that the loss of SPR1 positively impacts spaceflight adaptation. Conversely, the intensity of the sku5 responses suggests that the loss of SKU5 initiates a much more complex, deeper and more stress related response to spaceflight. This suggests that proper SKU5 function is important to spaceflight adaptation.",Introduction,Materials and Methods,Results,Discussion,,Conclusion,Root skewing-associated genes impact the spaceflight response of Arabidopsis thaliana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7064724/,

To address this deficiency, articular cartilage (AC) and sternal cartilage (SC) from mice exposed to 30 days of microgravity on the BION-M1 craft were investigated for pathological changes. The flight AC showed some evidence of degradation at the tissue level with loss of proteoglycan staining and a reduction in mRNA expression of mechano-responsive and structural cartilage matrix proteins compared to non-flight controls. These data suggest that degradative changes are underway in the AC extracellular matrix exposed to microgravity. In contrast, there was no evidence of cartilage breakdown in SC flight samples and the gene expression profile was distinct from that of AC with a reduction in metalloproteinase gene transcription. Since the two cartilages respond differently to microgravity we propose that each is tuned to the biomechanical environments in which they are normally maintained. That is, the differences between magnitude of normal terrestrial loading and the unloading of microgravity dictates the tissue response. Weight-bearing articular cartilage, but not minimally loaded sternal fibrocartilage, is negatively affected by the unloading of microgravity.

Recent sequencing of the microbiomes associated with plants and animals have shown that these interactions are essential for maintaining host health through the regulation of several metabolic and immune responses. Disruptions to various environmental parameters or community characteristics may impact the resiliency of the microbiome, thus potentially driving host-microbe associations towards disease. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of host-microbe interactions in microgravity and assess the impact of this unique environmental stress on the normal physiological and genetic responses of both pathogenic and mutualistic associations.

The squid-vibrio system exhibits two modifications of the brush border that supports the symbionts: effacement and repolarization. Together these occur on a daily rhythm in adult animals, at the dawn expulsion of symbionts into the environment, and symbiont colonization of the juvenile host induces an increase in microvillar density. Here we sought to define how these processes are related and the roles of both symbiont colonization and environmental cues. Ultrastructural analyses showed that the juvenile-organ brush borders also efface concomitantly with daily dawn-cued expulsion of symbionts. Manipulation of the environmental light cue and juvenile symbiotic state demonstrated that this behaviour requires the light cue, but not colonization. In contrast, symbionts were required for the observed increase in microvillar density that accompanies post dawn brush-border repolarization; this increase was induced solely by host exposure to phosphorylated lipid A of symbiont cells. These data demonstrate that a partnering of environmental and symbiont cues shapes the brush border and that microbe-associated molecular patterns play a role in the regulation of brush-border microarchitecture.",,,,,,,Environmental cues and symbiont microbe-associated molecular patterns function in concert to drive the daily remodelling of the crypt-cell brush border of the Euprymna scolopes light organ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5219934/,

LPS from V. fischeri is known to induce developmental apoptosis within its symbiotic tissues, which is accelerated under modeled microgravity conditions. In this study, we provide evidence that exposure to modeled microgravity increases the amount of LPS released by the bacterial symbiont in vitro.

Mutants of V. fischeri defective in the production and rotation of their flagella show significant decreases in LPS shedding in all treatments, but levels of LPS are higher under modeled microgravity despite loss of motility.

One aspect of spaceflight, microgravity, has been shown to perturb animal physiology thereby posing numerous health risks, including dysregulation of normal developmental pathways. Microgravity can also negatively impact the interactions between animals and their microbiomes. However, the effects of microgravity on developmental processes influenced by beneficial microbes, such as apoptosis, remains poorly understood. Here, the binary mutualism between the bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes, and the gram-negative bacterium, Vibrio fischeri, was studied under modeled microgravity conditions to elucidate how this unique stressor alters apoptotic cell death induced by beneficial microbes. Results Analysis of the host genome and transcriptome revealed a complex network of apoptosis genes affiliated with extrinsic/receptor-mediated and intrinsic/stress-induced apoptosis. Expression of apoptosis genes under modeled microgravity conditions occurred earlier and at high levels compared to gravity controls, in particular the expression of genes encoding initiator and executioner caspases. Functional assays of these apoptotic proteases revealed heightened activity under modeled microgravity; however, these increases could be mitigated using caspase inhibitors. Conclusions The outcomes of this study indicated that modeled microgravity alters the expression of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis gene expression and that this process is mediated in part by caspases. Modeled microgravity-associated increases of caspase activity can be pharmacologically inhibited suggesting that perturbations to the normal apoptosis signaling cascade can be mitigated, which may have broader implications for maintaining animal-microbial homeostasis in spaceflight.

This study evaluates the mechanism for increased virulence of the opportunistic gram-negative bacterium, Serratia marcescens, in simulated microgravity. Low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) is used in ground-based studies to simulate the effects of microgravity as experienced in spaceflight. Our previous findings showed that there was a significant increase in mortality rates of the Drosophila melanogaster host when infected with either spaceflight or LSMMG treated S. marcescens . Here, we report that LSMMG increases asparagine uptake and synthesis in S. marcescens and that the increased host lethality induced by LSMMG bacteria grown in rich media can be recapitulated in minimal media by adding only aspartate and glutamine, the substrates of asparagine biosynthesis. Interestingly, increased bacterial growth rate alone is not sufficient to contribute to maximal host lethality, since the addition of aspartate to minimal media caused an LSMMG-specific increase in bacterial growth rate that is comparable to that induced by the combination of aspartate and glutamine, but this increase in growth does not cause an equivalent rate of host mortality. However, the addition of both aspartate and glutamine cause both an increase in host mortality and an overexpression of asparagine pathway genes in a LSMMG-dependent manner. We also report that L-asparaginase-mediated breakdown of asparagine is an effective countermeasure for the increased host mortality caused by LSMMG-treated bacteria. This investigation underscores the importance of the asparagine utilization pathway by helping uncover molecular mechanisms that underlie increased mortality rates of a model host infected with microgravity-treated S. marcescens and provides a potential mitigation strategy.",Introduction,Methods,Results,Discussion,,,Asparagine biosynthesis as a mechanism of increased host lethality induced by Serratia marcescens in simulated microgravity environments,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9111996/,

This strain was identified as a gram-positive, rod-shaped, oxidase-positive, catalase-negative motile bacterium in the genus Cohnella , designated as F6_2S_P_1 T . The 16S sequence of the F6_2S_P_1 T strain places it in a clade with C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli , which were originally isolated from plant tissue or rhizosphere environments. The closest 16S and gyrB matches to strain F6_2S_P_1 T are to C. rhizosphaerae with 98.84 and 93.99% sequence similarity, while a core single-copy gene phylogeny from all publicly available Cohnella genomes places it as more closely related to C. ginsengisoli . Average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) values to any described Cohnella species are <89 and <22%, respectively. The major fatty acids for strain F6_2S_P_1 T are anteiso-C 15:0 (51.7%), iso-C 16:0 (23.1%), and iso-C 15:0 (10.5%), and it is able to metabolize a wide range of carbon compounds. Given the results of the ANI and dDDH analyses, this ISS strain is a novel species within the genus Cohnella for which we propose the name Cohnella hashimotonis , with the type strain F6_2S_P_1 T (=NRRL B-65657 T and DSMZ 115098 T ). Because no closely related Cohnella genomes were available, this study generated the whole-genome sequences (WGSs) of the type strains for C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli .

We also characterized the branch of Cohnella within which C. hashimotonis is placed and predicted functional characteristics of C. hashimotonis and the C. ginsengisoli clade as a whole. All species of Cohnella closely related to C. hashimotonis are from the plant/rhizosphere environment and likely have mutualistic associations with plant roots or other tissue. It is likely, therefore, that C. hashimotonis was introduced to the ISS not as a human commensal but as a plant commensal during one of the many plant growth experiments conducted on board. Nevertheless, C. hashimotonis can clearly survive in the extreme conditions of the ISS built environment, including radiation exposure, desiccation, low nutrient availability, and microgravity, and is closely related to a number of rhizosphere bacteria; it is therefore a promising candidate for testing as a member of plant-growth-promoting consortia for future plant experiments in outer space.","Description of Cohnella hashimotonis sp. nov. Cohnella hashimotonis (ha.shi.mo.to.nis. masc. n. hashimotonis named in honor of Professor Hideo Hashimoto, a food microbiologist from Hiroshima Univ., Japan). Cells are endospore-forming, aerobic, and gram-positive rods, 0.5–0.6 μm in width and 0.8–100+ μm in length. In addition to normal cells, elongated, spaghetti-like cells ( Figures 4D , 5B ) are observed in light microscopy and SEM images. Colonies are translucent cream-colored, acquiring a pinkish tinge after multiple days of growth, and grow well on R2A but poorly on TSA. Growth occurs at between 15 and 37°C, between pHs 6 and 8, and from 0 to 3% NaCl. Colonies are weakly oxidase-positive and catalase-negative. This species reduces nitrate to nitrite, produces dextrin from starch, and utilizes the following carbon substrates: alanine, histidine, serine, sucrose, L-arabinose, melibiose, D-fructose, inositol, and lactose. The following substances are utilized for acid production: maltose, sucrose, D-fructose, D-ribose, N-acetyl, glucosamine, lactose, and trisodium citrate. Major fatty acids composing C. hashimotonis are anteiso-C 15:0 (51.7%), iso-C 16:0 (23.1%), and iso-C 15:0 (10.5%). The polar lipids are diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, three aminophospholipids, and a phospholipid. The major quinone system is menaquinones MK-7. The cell-wall peptidoglycan of strain contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diamino acid. C. hashimotonis is closely related to C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli based on 16 rRNA gene sequence similarity (<99%). However, the phylogenetic position of the strain F6_2S_P_1 T was resolved as a novel species due to gyrB sequence similarity (<94%), ANI (<89%), and dDDH (<35%) analyses with any other sequenced Cohnella species. GC content is 58.37%. The type strain F6_2S_P_1 T was isolated from the wall behind the Waste Hygiene Compartment, i.e., the space toilet, aboard the ISS, in 2018; its genome is available on NCBI, accession number JAGRPV000000000 .

However, metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of ISS samples are yet to be generated and subjected to various genomic analyses, including phylogenetic affiliation, predicted functional pathways, antimicrobial resistance, and virulence characteristics. Results In total, 46 MAGs were assembled from 21 ISS environmental metagenomes, in which metaSPAdes yielded 20 MAGs and metaWRAP generated 26 MAGs. Among 46 MAGs retrieved, 18 bacterial species were identified, including one novel genus/species combination ( Kalamiella piersonii ) and one novel bacterial species ( Methylobacterium ajmalii ). In addition, four bins exhibited fungal genomes; this is the first-time fungal genomes were assembled from ISS metagenomes. Phylogenetic analyses of five bacterial species showed ISS-specific evolution. The genes pertaining to cell membranes, such as transmembrane transport, cell wall organization, and regulation of cell shape, were enriched. Variations in the antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) and virulence genes of the selected 20 MAGs were characterized to predict the ecology and evolution of biosafety level (BSL) 2 microorganisms in space. Since microbial virulence increases in microgravity, AMR gene sequences of MAGs were compared with genomes of respective ISS isolates and corresponding type strains. Among these 20 MAGs characterized, AMR genes were more prevalent in the Enterobacter bugandensis MAG, which has been predominantly isolated from clinical samples. MAGs were further used to analyze if genes involved in AMR and biofilm formation of viable microbes in ISS have variation due to generational evolution in microgravity and radiation pressure. Conclusions Comparative analyses of MAGs and whole-genome sequences of related ISS isolates and their type strains were characterized to understand the variation related to the microbial evolution under microgravity. The Pantoea / Kalamiella strains have the maximum single-nucleotide polymorphisms found within the ISS strains examined. This may suggest that Pantoea / Kalamiella strains are much more subjective to microgravity changes. The reconstructed genomes will enable researchers to study the evolution of genomes under microgravity and low-dose irradiation compared to the evolution of microbes here on Earth.

Even though most of these microbes are benign, antibiotic-resistant pathogens can colonize and emerge indoors, creating infection risk through surface transmission or inhalation. Several studies have catalogued the microbial composition and ecology in different built environment types. These have informed in vitro studies that seek to replicate the physicochemical features that promote pathogenic survival and transmission, ultimately facilitating the development and validation of intervention techniques used to reduce pathogen accumulation. Such interventions include using Bacillus -based cleaning products on surfaces or integrating bacilli into printable materials. Though this work is in its infancy, early research suggests the potential to use microbial biocontrol to reduce hospital- and home-acquired multidrug-resistant infections. Although these techniques hold promise, there is an urgent need to better understand the microbial ecology of built environments and to determine how these biocontrol solutions alter species interactions. This review covers our current understanding of microbial ecology of the built environment and proposes strategies to translate that knowledge into effective biocontrol of antibiotic-resistant pathogens.",Introduction,,,,,Conclusions and future directions,Biocontrol in built environments to reduce pathogen exposure and infection risk.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10848226/,

A wide range of signaling molecules are trafficked through the plant, but a trio of potentially interacting messengers, reactive oxygen species (ROS), Ca 2+ and electrical signaling (‘trio signaling’) appear to form a network supporting rapid signal transmission. The molecular components underlying this rapid communication are beginning to be identified, such as the ROS producing NAPDH oxidase RBOHD, the ion channel two pore channel 1 (TPC1), and glutamate receptor-like channels GLR3.3 and GLR3.6. The plant cell wall presents a plant-specific route for possible propagation of signals from cell to cell. However, the degree to which the cell wall limits information exchange between cells via transfer of small molecules through an extracellular route, or whether it provides an environment to facilitate transmission of regulators such as ROS or H + remains to be determined. Similarly, the role of plasmodesmata as both conduits and gatekeepers for the propagation of rapid cell-to-cell signaling remains a key open question. Regardless of how signals move from cell to cell, they help prepare distant parts of the plant for impending challenges from specific biotic or abiotic stresses.",,,,,,,"Orchestrating rapid long-distance signaling in plants with Ca2+ , ROS, and electrical signals",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5677518/,

PMC7076552,10.3389/fpls.2020.00147,Test of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptome: A Discovery Environment to Explore Multiple Plant Biology Spaceflight Experiments,Frontiers in Plant Science,2020,"Barker, R; Lombardino, J; Rasmussen, K; Gilroy, S","Recent advances in the routine access to space along with increasing opportunities to perform plant growth experiments on board the International Space Station have led to an ever-increasing body of transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenomic data from plants experiencing spaceflight. These datasets hold great promise to help understand how plant biology reacts to this unique environment. However, analyses that mine across such expanses of data are often complex to implement, being impeded by the sheer number of potential comparisons that are possible. Complexities in how the output of these multiple parallel analyses can be presented to the researcher in an accessible and intuitive form provides further barriers to such research. Recent developments in computational systems biology have led to rapid advances in interactive data visualization environments designed to perform just such tasks. However, to date none of these tools have been tailored to the analysis of the broad-ranging plant biology spaceflight data. We have therefore developed the Test Of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptome (TOAST) database ( https://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast ) to address this gap in our capabilities. TOAST is a relational database that uses the Qlik database management software to link plant biology, spaceflight-related omics datasets, and their associated metadata. This environment helps visualize relationships across multiple levels of experiments in an easy to use gene-centric platform. TOAST draws on data from The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA’s) GeneLab and other data repositories and also connects results to a suite of web-based analytical tools to facilitate further investigation of responses to spaceflight and related stresses. The TOAST graphical user interface allows for quick comparisons between plant spaceflight experiments using real-time, gene-specific queries, or by using functional gene ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway, or other filtering systems to explore genetic networks of interest. Testing of the database shows that TOAST confirms patterns of gene expression already highlighted in the literature, such as revealing the modulation of oxidative stress-related responses across multiple plant spaceflight experiments. However, this data exploration environment can also drive new insights into patterns of spaceflight responsive gene expression. For example, TOAST analyses highlight changes to mitochondrial function as likely shared responses in many plant spaceflight experiments.",Introduction,,,,"The TOAST User Interface Figure 3 shows the web interface for TOAST, which launches as an overview menu of dashboard icons. Clicking on the first few dashboards links to introductory materials about space or Arabidopsis research providing an entry point for the non-specialist. Most of the remaining icons are links to datasets from individual experiments. The design of each icon gives quick visual information on the nature of the experiment (spacecraft, plant type, hardware, assay type) and clicking on the icon opens the particular dataset. The final set of icons represent links to online tools that can be used to further analyze the results emerging from using the TOAST database. The linked tools are summarized in Supplementary Table 2 . Figure 3 The TOAST 4.5 user interface. (A) The web interface for TOAST launches an overview menu of dashboard icons allowing the user to directly access the introductory materials, omics data, and related analysis tools. (B) Each icon provides a visual summary of the data or tools that it links to including elements such as spaceflight vehicle (e.g., Shuttle, ISS, Shenzou vs ground-based experimentation), the growth hardware used, plant/seedling vs cell culture experiment, RNAseq vs microarray vs proteomics, species and ecotype and dataset identifier (e.g., GLDS number). Within TOAST, each dataset is presented to the user as an interactive dashboard with Log10-fold change and measure of statistical significance (P-value) provided for each locus as shown in Figure 4 . We have used P- rather than Q-value as our initial metric of significance to provide as broad an overview of significantly differentially expressed genes as possible. Q-values are corrected P-values that take into account the cumulative errors that occur when making multiple tests of significance within a large dataset. The Q-value is available in the downloadable data tables (see below), allowing users to apply this more stringent statistical metric as needed. Volcano plots (plots of fold-change versus statistical significance of that change for each gene ID) were chosen as the main way to visualize both the statistical analysis and the degree of gene induction or repression. A side table displays the gene identifier, the gene symbol, the fold-change and P-value and Q-value for each locus. The user can toggle on and off the P-value statistical significance filters on the volcano plot to rapidly assess the strength of the inferences to be drawn from the results that they are visualizing. All of these data can also be downloaded and used with a range of other databases that are linked in the TOAST overview menu ( Figure 3 ). TOAST 4.5 includes a GO database ( Ashburner et al., 2000 ; Carbon et al., 2019 ) that provides real time feedback on the ontology of the subsets of genes selected. Tabs above the interactive bar charts allow access to four main types of annotation: GO Molecular function (16,504 categories), GO Cellular component (15,383 categories), GO Biological process (15,644 categories), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways [KEGG; ( Kanehisa et al., 2017 )]. KEGG is a widely used database that categorizes genes into the cellular pathways in which they are involved. In addition, gene selections can be interactively compared against the AGRIS transcription factor database [1,851 loci; ( Palaniswamy et al., 2006 )], the TAIR10 microRNA database ( Lamesch et al., 2012 ), or be filtered using a selection of over 60 manually curated gene families. A further selection allows comparison to known sites of spaceflight-induced epigenetic modification ( Zhou et al., 2019 ). These filters are applied using a drop-down menu. NCBI PubMed links to any associated publication are also embedded alongside these data analysis tools to provide the critical context of the original published experimental descriptions and analyses (a summary of literature linked within TOAST is shown in Supplementary Table 1 ). Figure 4 Graphical user interface for typical dataset. Clicking on a volcano plot also activates an interactive graphical tool for manual selection of groups of genes of interest. *Defaults to showing 33.43K, i.e., all Entrez identifiers, until a filter or gene selection is applied. Inset, a lasso tool allows user selection of data points from volcano plot in addition to activation of filters such as on significance of change, KEGG Pathway, or GO annotation. These data exploration features were implemented using D3 JavaScript software libraries executed within the Qlik environment, connecting the spaceflight data, its pre-computed statistics ( Figure 2 ) and information on functional ontology. This system architecture facilitates user interaction with massive amounts of data in real time. Thus, as shown in Figure 5 , the user selects a dashboard containing their initial dataset of interest. The software then allows them to interactively select genes or groups of genes either manually from the volcano plots, by filtering using gene ontology terms, or via a text-based interface as described above. As the user explores the data, they can apply further rounds of filtering and/or manual selection of groups of genes. These stacked filters spawn to all other datasets such that opening another dashboard of information on another experiment will show the equivalently filtered results. Further filtering of these newly opened data will, in turn, filter back on the original and all other datasets. This reiterative filtering approach allows the user to focus on an ever smaller number of genes selected by comparisons across multiple experiments. These results can be exported as a spreadsheet and/or passed to other web-based analytical sites linked within the TOAST interface. Figure 5 Overview of use of the TOAST 4.5 database. (1a) The user selects an initial study of interest and then can review the summary of its metadata to ensure it is the correct focus for study (1b). The dataset is then opened and (2) when the study is selected an interactive dashboard launches and the user has a direct link to any associated manuscript. Gene filtering: statistical (3a), gene ontology (3b), and other related functional filters can be applied to focus the number of loci being visualized in the volcano plot (3c) to genes of interest. In addition, the volcano plot itself can be interactively manually filtered using a graphical selection tool. All filters can be toggled on and off using selectable tabs at the top of the interface (3d). If an interesting subset of loci are selected the user can activate the download option (4a) and save the related data in word or xml format (4b). (5) The user can also perform further bioinformatic and statistical analysis with other online tools linked from the main user interface.","TOAST Metadata App A custom metadata app is also incorporated as a tool for use with TOAST ( https://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast/tutorial-metadata ). This additional relational database provides data visualization tools that use the metadata associated with each dataset to find associations in factors such as experimental design parameters, hardware, and features of the spaceflight mission between different experiments in TOAST 4.5. GeneLab provides a rich array of metadata associated with its datasets. Most of the other non-GeneLab datasets incorporated into TOAST do not provide these kinds of metadata summaries and so we manually curated both the GeneLab and non-GeneLab datasets within TOAST 4.5 to provide equivalent metadata for all. These experiment-related factors are presented in Supplementary Table 3 and drive the visualizations presented in the metadata app. Figure 6A shows the main dashboard for the metadata app. Clicking on an icon launches the associated dashboard where interactive visualizations can, in turn, filter on the range of factors that are presented ( Figure 6B ). This architecture allows the user to explore commonalities in the available plant biology data in TOAST 4.5 ranging from lighting conditions, hardware or plant age at time of assay to analytical approach and even PI of the group performing the experiment (See Supplementary Table 3 for comprehensive list of factors). Within the app there are several places where “ROS meta-analysis variable” appears on the visualization. This description is used to denote that the data comes from a published meta-analysis of many publicly available microarray experiments related to responses to reactive oxygen species (ROS) called “The ROS-wheel” ( Willems et al., 2016 ). Thus, for this particular comparative dataset there is not a single value of, e.g., for light level or plant age (as it is an aggregation of many individual experiments).

(A) Initial dashboards allow access to comparisons between a range of experiment-related factors such as lighting conditions, growth environment, and plant genotypes.

We show that when the bacterial elicitor peptide flg22 is used to trigger immune responses in mutants missing tonoplast Ca 2+ pumps, it causes disrupted Ca 2+ signals that are higher in amplitude than expected from wild-type plants. Relocalization of a Ca 2+ pump normally found in the plasma membrane to the tonoplast rescues both the tonoplast pump knockout mutant’s immune-related phenotypes and aberrant Ca 2+ signaling dynamics. These observations support the notion that tonoplast-localized pumps are critical for the proper maintenance of Ca 2+ dynamics in innate immune responses but that any regulatory systems specific to the endogenous tonoplast pumps may not be required to support these signaling events.",,Materials and Methods,Results,Discussion,"Elevated Temperature Suppresses Lesion Formation and flg22-Dependent Ca 2+ Signals in aca4/11 . Many lesion-mimic mutants exhibit lesion suppression when grown in elevated temperatures ( 20 , 26 ), likely due to reduced biosynthesis of the phytohormone salicylic acid ( 27 ). While aca4/11 plants grown at 22 °C exhibited dwarfism and eventually formed lesions, growth at 28 °C suppressed both of these aca4/11 phenotypes, an effect that became more obvious as the plants grew larger rosettes ( Fig. 4 A ). We also used molecular markers of the flg22 response to characterize how aca4/11 may affect induction of defense pathways. We first characterized that in wild-type, a 30-min time point after flg22 treatment captured the induction of CPB60g , PHI1 , ICS1 , and FRK1 , all components of PTI induction ( 28 , 29 ). We also confirmed that the basal expression of these genes was not significantly altered in the various genotypes or under the temperature regimes used in the absence of flg22 ( SI Appendix , Fig. S5 ). Importantly, FRK1 encodes a receptor-like protein kinase that is thought to function in a pathway independent of the flg22-signaling events mediated through the Ca 2+ -dependent protein kinases CPK4, -5, -6, and -11 ( 29 ). Thus, FRK1 provided us with a marker that may operate independently of Ca 2+ signal dynamics, and so of aca4/11 -related effects. Indeed, we observed that the 30-min flg22-dependent increase in FRK1 , PHI1 , and ICS1 transcripts were unaltered in the aca4/11 background when compared to wild-type Col-0 plants ( Fig. 4 B ). However, induction of the defense regulator CBP60g and resistance to Pst bacterial challenge (seen as a reduction in extractable colony forming units of bacteria) were both elevated in aca4/11 plants, with the resistance phenotype being most evident over the initial invasion at 1 d postinoculation (1 DPI) ( Fig. 4 C ). As seen for the dwarfing phenotype, suppression of both flg22-induced elevation of defense gene induction and pathogen resistance occurred in aca4/11 at 28 °C ( Fig. 4 B and C ). Fig. 4. Elevated temperature suppresses lesion formation and flg22-dependent Ca 2+ signals in Col-0 and aca4/11 . ( A ) Rosette area measurements of Col-0 and aca4/11 grown at 22 °C or 28 °C for 14 or 25 d postgermination (DPG).

( B ) Transcript levels of 10-d-old seedlings treated with 1 µM flg22 for 30 min. Relative fold-change (2 −ΔΔCt ) were obtained by normalizing to Col-0 at 0 min ( SI Appendix , Fig. S5 A ).

( E ) Cotyledon Δ R / R 0 indicating that Col-0 and aca4/11 grown and imaged at 28 °C exhibit attenuated Ca 2+ signals in response to flg22 ( n ≥ 15); To aid in comparisons, Col-0 and aca4/11 22 °C data are reproduced from Fig. 2 . Dashed line indicates time points in which both Col-0 and aca4/11 grown at 28 °C are significantly different from both Col-0 and aca4/11 grown at 22 °C (two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni HSD; P < 0.05). Since the above aca4/11 phenotypes were suppressed at 28 °C, we sought to determine if elevated temperature could also suppress the disrupted flg22-dependent Ca 2+ responses. Growth at 28 °C caused a reduction in the magnitude of this response in both Col-0 and aca4/11 , with the degree of aca4/11 response at 28 °C now closely mirroring that of Col-0 at this temperature ( Fig. 4 E ). Interestingly, the FRET:CFP values for aca4/11 were still significantly higher than Col-0 at both 22 °C and 28 °C and Col-0 baseline was higher at 28 °C than 22 °C ( Fig. 4 D and SI Appendix , Fig. S6 ). Thus, growth at elevated temperature appeared to raise the basal Ca 2+ level in both Col-0 and aca4/11 , but also dampened the subsequent flg22-induced Ca 2+ increase to the same degree in both backgrounds. One explanation of these altered response kinetics between aca4/11 and Col-0 at altered temperatures would be that the sensitivity of the plants to flg22 had changed through alteration in FLS2 levels, rather than more directly affecting Ca 2+ homeostatic and signaling-related mechanisms. However, we did not detect any significant differences in FLS2 protein or FLS2 transcript levels between genotypes or temperature treatments, suggesting that the differences in flg22-dependent Ca 2+ signaling is independent of FLS2 receptor levels and likely reflects temperature-related events downstream of receptor activation ( SI Appendix , Fig. S7 ).","Tonoplast Localization of ACA8 Rescues aca4/11 -Associated Phenotypes. It is known that the aca4/11 lesioning phenotype is rescued by expression of either ACA4 or ACA11 in this mutant background ( 14 ). Such data provide a clear link between lesioning behavior and these two tonoplast ACAs. The rescue likely works as the native pumps, with all of their regulatory systems, are being reintroduced into the membrane in which they normally operate. Indeed, the ACAs form a multigene family with clades that map to particular organellar membranes ( SI Appendix , Fig. S8 ), and thus it seems likely that particular family members are tailored to operate within the lipid milieu and regulatory networks associated with a particular membrane environment. We asked if this idea was true by targeting a nontonoplast ACA to the tonoplast of the aca4/11 double knockout and assessing its ability to rescue the double-knockout phenotypes. We chose to relocalize ACA8, a plasma membrane pump, to the tonoplast due to its significant divergence from ACA4 and ACA11 in its N-terminal autoinhibitory domain. This is the region where much of this family of pump’s regulation has been localized ( 30 – 33 ) and where a large amount of its isoform-dependent amino acid sequence diversity resides ( SI Appendix , Fig. S8 ). In order to relocalize ACA8, we deleted its C-terminal tail and replaced it with the analogous region of ACA11 (thus creating the chimeric ACA8-11C). The C terminus of ACA11 contains two sequences indicative of tonoplast localization, a dileucine (DXXXLL) and a tyrosine (YXXΦ) motif, where X is any amino acid and Φ is a bulky hydrophobic amino acid ( SI Appendix , Fig. S9 ) ( 29 , 34 ). Furthermore, we created a version of the ACA8-11C chimeric pump with a point mutation in the P-loop of the core pump region (ACA8-D482A) that converted a conserved aspartate known to be important for pump activity into an alanine, effectively inactivating the pump ( 35 ). For both ACA8-11C and its D482A variant we generated versions tagged at the C terminus with mGFP5 (for localization studies). We also made ACA8-11C with a FLAG tag that we used in Ca 2+ imaging experiments as the mGFP5 tag interferes with the imaging of the CFP/YFP-based YC-Nano65 Ca 2+ sensor probe we have used. All pump variants were driven by the constitutive AtUBQ10 promoter. Fig. 5 shows that both ACA8-11C-mGFP5 and D482A-mGFP5 colocalized with the dye LysoTrackerRed DND-99, known to label the acidic vacuolar lumen and highlight the tonoplast membrane ( 36 – 39 ). We confirmed that DND-99 is a robust tonoplast marker in pavement cells by showing it colocalizes with the tonoplast-localized protein γ-TIP-CFP ( 40 ) ( Fig. 5 ). Further analyses throughout the plant indicated that neither ACA8-11C-mGFP5, D482A-mGFP5, nor γ-TIP-CFP colocalized with the plasma membrane marker FM5-95 in, for example, cells of the root differentiation and elongation zone, leaf guard cells, or in shoot-derived protoplasts, suggesting that ACA8-11C-mGFP5 and D482A-mGFP5 were relocalized from the plasma membrane to the tonoplast ( Fig. 5 and SI Appendix , Fig. S10 ). Although such relocalization is likely being driven by the C-terminal di-leucine and tyrosine motifs we had engineered onto this protein, we cannot discount that overexpression alone is driving mistargeting of the chimeric pump. Irrespective of precise retargeting mechanism, our results indicate tonoplast localization of the ACA8-11C and D482A-mGFP5. Fig. 5. The C terminus of ACA11 localizes ACA8 to the tonoplast.

The yellow arrow on each respective merged image indicates the direction of the fluorescent intensity profiles for both FM5-95 and the fluorescent protein of each corresponding genotype. (Scale bars, 5 μm.) ACA8-11C-mGFP5, but not D482A-mGFP5, was able to rescue the growth and lesion phenotype of aca4/11 ( Fig. 6 A and SI Appendix , Fig. S11 ), suggesting that ACA8 must retain functional pump capacity to rescue the double-knockout phenotype. Importantly, overexpression of ACA8 at its native location at the plasma membrane did not rescue these phenotypes in the aca4/11 background, indicating that Ca 2+ efflux activity specifically at the tonoplast is required for rescue ( SI Appendix , Fig. S12 ). In parallel experiments, UBQ10::ACA8-11C-FLAG was transformed into aca4/11 plants expressing YC-Nano65, revealing that basal Ca 2+ levels and flg22-dependent Ca 2+ signals were similar to Col-0 and significantly lower than the aca4/11 mutant ( Fig. 6 C , SI Appendix , Fig. S6 , and Movie S5 ), These results indicated that the relocalized pump had also rescued the Ca 2+ phenotype of aca4/11. Interestingly, following the flg22 Ca 2+ response over time scales that captured recovery from the initial flg22-induced peak in [Ca 2+ ] cyt indicated that both Col-0 and aca4/11 could restore basal Ca 2+ levels at similar time points despite aca4/11 showing an elevated peak Ca 2+ amplitude after flg22 treatment ( Fig. 6 C ). Furthermore, expression of ACA8-11C-FLAG in the aca4/11 background restored longer-term recovery kinetics to resemble wild-type. Although there was an apparent trend for setting even lower Ca 2+ levels than in wild-type over this recovery period in these ACA8-11C-FLAG lines, this change was not statistically significant.

Data represent mean ± SD of four biological replicates and three independent experiments. Columns with different letters are statistically different (one-way ANOVA; Tukey’s HSD; P < 0.05). We also found that the flg22-induction of defense transcripts that we previously noted as not being altered in the aca4/11 background ( FRK1 , PHI1 , and ICS1 ) ( Fig. 6 B ) was unaffected by expressing either ACA8-11C or D482A in the aca4/11 background (although PHI1 did show a small reduction in levels of induction from ∼12- to ∼10-fold when D482A was expressed, and FRK1 increased from ∼10- to ∼13-fold). However, induction of CPB60g and Pst resistance, features that we have previously seen to be altered in aca4/11 ( Fig. 6 B and D ), were rescued to wild-type–like levels by expressing ACA8-11C-mGFP5, but not D482A-mGFP5 ( Fig. 6 B and D ). Again, the effects on the defense phenotype of aca4/11 was most evident in the earlier stages of invasion at 1 DPI ( Fig. 6 D ).",Tonoplast-localized Ca2+ pumps regulate Ca2+ signals during pattern-triggered immunity in Arabidopsis thaliana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7414185/,

In addition to the redistribution of chemical messengers that range from RNAs and peptides to hormones and metabolites, a communication system acting through the transmission of electrical, Ca2+, reactive oxygen species and potentially even hydraulic signals has also been discovered. This latter system can propagate signals across many cells each second and researchers are now beginning to uncover the molecular machineries behind this rapid communications network. Thus, elements such as the reactive oxygen species producing NAPDH oxidases and ion channels of the two pore channel, glutamate receptor-like and cyclic nucleotide gated families are all required for the rapid propagation of these signals. Upon arrival at their distant targets, these changes trigger responses ranging from the production of hormones, to changes in the levels of primary metabolites and shifts in patterns of gene expression. These systemic responses occur within seconds to minutes of perception of the initial, local signal, allowing for the rapid deployment of plant-wide responses.

Tolerance to anoxia is relevant to wetland species, rice ( Oryza sativa ) cultivation, and submergence tolerance of crops. Decoding and transmitting calcium (Ca) signals may be an important component to anoxia tolerance; however, the contribution of intracellular Ca transporters to this process is poorly understood. Four functional ca tion/proton e x changers (CAX1–4) in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) help regulate Ca homeostasis around the vacuole. Our results demonstrate that cax1 mutants are more tolerant to both anoxic conditions and submergence. Using phenotypic measurements, RNA-sequencing, and proteomic approaches, we identified cax1 -mediated anoxia changes that phenocopy changes present in anoxia-tolerant crops: altered metabolic processes, diminished reactive oxygen species production post anoxia, and altered hormone signaling. Comparing wild-type and cax1 expressing genetically encoded Ca indicators demonstrated altered cytosolic Ca signals in cax1 during reoxygenation. Anoxia-induced Ca signals around the plant vacuole are involved in the control of numerous signaling events related to adaptation to low oxygen stress.

To help understand the plant response to this complex suite of factors this study compared transcriptomic analysis of 15 Arabidopsis thaliana spaceflight experiments deposited in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s GeneLab data repository. These data were reanalyzed for genes showing significant differential expression in spaceflight versus ground controls using a single common computational pipeline for either the microarray or the RNA-seq datasets. Such a standardized approach to analysis should greatly increase the robustness of comparisons made between datasets. This analysis was coupled with extensive cross-referencing to a curated matrix of metadata associated with these experiments. Our study reveals that factors such as analysis type (i.e., microarray versus RNA-seq) or environmental and hardware conditions have important confounding effects on comparisons seeking to define plant reactions to spaceflight. The metadata matrix allows selection of studies with high similarity scores, i.e., that share multiple elements of experimental design, such as plant age or flight hardware.

To better understand mechanisms involved in rapid, radiation-induced bone loss, we determined the influence of total body irradiation on expression of select cytokines known both to stimulate osteoclastogenesis and contribute to inflammatory bone disease. Adult (16 week), male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to either 2 Gy gamma rays ( 137 Cs, 0.8 Gy/min) or heavy ions ( 56 Fe, 600MeV, 0.50–1.1 Gy/min); this dose corresponds to either a single fraction of radiotherapy (typical total dose is ≥10 Gy) or accumulates over long-duration interplanetary missions. Serum, marrow, and mineralized tissue were harvested 4 h—7 days later. Gamma irradiation caused a prompt (2.6-fold within 4 h) and persistent (peaking at 4.1-fold within 1 day) rise in the expression of the obligate osteoclastogenic cytokine, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand ( Rankl ), within marrow cells over controls. Similarly, Rankl expression peaked in marrow cells within 3 days of iron exposure (9.2-fold). Changes in Rankl expression induced by gamma irradiation preceded and overlapped with a rise in expression of other pro-osteoclastic cytokines in marrow (eg, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 increased by 11.9-fold, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha increased by 1.7-fold over controls). The ratio, Rankl/Opg , in marrow increased by 1.8-fold, a net pro-resorption balance. In the marrow, expression of the antioxidant transcription factor, Nfe2l2 , strongly correlated with expression levels of Nfatc1 , Csf1 , Tnf , and Rankl . Radiation exposure increased a serum marker of bone resorption (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase) and led to cancellous bone loss (16% decrement after 1 week). We conclude that total body irradiation (gamma or heavy-ion) caused temporal elevations in the concentrations of specific genes expressed within marrow and mineralized tissue related to bone resorption, including select cytokines that lead to osteoclastogenesis and elevated resorption; this is likely to account for rapid and progressive deterioration of cancellous microarchitecture following exposure to ionizing radiation.",Introduction,Materials and Methods,Results,Discussion,,,Ionizing Radiation Stimulates Expression of Pro-Osteoclastogenic Genes in Marrow and Skeletal Tissue,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4490751/,

The resources and time it takes to harvest tissues post-euthanasia, and the methods and duration of long duration storage, potentially have negative impacts on sample quantity and quality, thereby limiting the scientific outcome that can be achieved. Objectives The goals of this study were to optimize methods for both sample recovery and science return from rodent experiments, with possible relevance to both ground based and spaceflight studies. The first objective was to determine the impacts of tissue harvest time post-euthanasia, preservation methods, and storage duration, focusing on RNA quality and enzyme activities in liver and spleen as indices of sample quality. The second objective was to develop methods that will maximize science return by dissecting multiple tissues after long duration storage in situ at -80°C. Methods Tissues of C57Bl/6J mice were dissected and preserved at various time points post-euthanasia and stored at -80°C for up to 11 months. In some experiments, tissues were recovered from frozen carcasses which had been stored at -80°C up to 7 months. RNA quantity and quality was assessed by measuring RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Additionally, the quality of tissues was assessed by measuring activities of hepatic enzymes (catalase, glutathione reductase and GAPDH). Results Fresh tissues were collected up to one hour post-euthanasia, and stored up to 11 months at -80°C, with minimal adverse effects on the RNA quality of either livers or RNAlater-preserved spleens. Liver enzyme activities were similar to those of positive controls, with no significant effect observed at any time point. Tissues dissected from frozen carcasses that had been stored for up to 7 months at -80°C had variable results, depending on the specific tissue analyzed. RNA quality of liver, heart, and kidneys were minimally affected after 6–7 months of storage at -80°C, whereas RNA degradation was evident in tissues such as small intestine, bone, and bone marrow when they were collected from the carcasses frozen for 2.5 months. Conclusion These results demonstrate that 1) the protocols developed for spaceflight experiments with on-orbit dissections support the retrieval of high quality samples for RNA expression and some protein analyses, despite delayed preservation post-euthanasia or prolonged storage, and 2) many additional tissues for gene expression analysis can be obtained by dissection even following prolonged storage of the tissue in situ at -80°C.

Tail suspension, a widely used spaceflight analog, is reported to result in vascular remodeling of rats. However, little is known about the cellular atlas of the heterogeneous cells of CA and FA from hindlimb-unloaded rats. Methods Firstly, we leveraged scRNA-seq to perform clustering analysis to identify diverse cell populations and sub-clusters within CA and FA from rats subjected to 3 months of hindlimb unloading. The dysregulated genes specific for artery types and cell types in HU group compared to Con were unraveled. Then R package “Cellchat” was used to reveal ligand-receptor cellular communication. At last, the TF network analysis was performed using the SCENIC R package to predict the pivotal TFs in rat artery remodeling induced by hindlimb unloading. Results Clustering analysis identified ECs, SMCs, fibroblasts, and a spectrum of immune cells, as well as neuronal and stem cells. Notably, an increased percentage of ECs in the CA and a diminished proportion of SMCs in both CA and FA were observed following tail suspension. Intersection of dysregulated genes specific for artery type and cell type after tail suspension revealed several gene sets involved in ECM remodeling, inflammation, vasoconstriction, etc. Fibroblasts, in particular, exhibited the most significant gene expression variability, highlighting their plasticity. Subclustering within ECs, SMCs and fibroblasts revealed specialized subsets engaged in processes such as EndoMT and cell cycle checkpoint regulation. Additionally, enhanced intercellular interactions among major cell types, especially between SMC and fibroblast, underscored the importance of cell communication in vascular remodeling. Several TFs were identified as potentially influential in the vascular remodeling process under simulated microgravity conditions. Conclusions This study presents the first cellular atlas of the conductive arteries in hindlimb-unloaded rats, revealing a spectrum of dysregulated gene profiles. The identification of the subclusters of ECs, SMCs and fibroblasts, cellular communication analysis and transcription factors prediction are also included in this work.

Most HU studies are performed with singly housed animals, although social isolation also can substantially impact behavior and physiology, and therefore may confound HU experimental results. Other HU variants that allow for paired housing have been developed although no systematic assessment has been made to understand the effects of social isolation on HU outcomes. Hence, we aimed to determine the contribution of social isolation to tissue responses to HU. To accomplish this, we developed a refinement to the traditional NASA Ames single housing HU system to accommodate social housing in pairs, retaining desirable features of the original design. We conducted a 30-day HU experiment with adult, female mice that were either singly or socially housed. HU animals in both single and social housing displayed expected musculoskeletal deficits versus housing matched, normally loaded (NL) controls. However, select immune and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responses were differentially impacted by the HU social environment relative to matched NL controls. HU led to a reduction in % CD4 + T cells in singly housed, but not in socially housed mice. Unexpectedly, HU increased adrenal gland mass in socially housed but not singly housed mice, while social isolation increased adrenal gland mass in NL controls. HU also led to elevated plasma corticosterone levels at day 30 in both singly and socially housed mice. Thus, musculoskeletal responses to simulated weightlessness are similar regardless of social environment with a few differences in adrenal and immune responses. Our findings show that combined stressors can mask, not only exacerbate, select responses to HU.

It is becoming evident that mitochondrial dysfunction may regulate pathways controlling muscle mass. We have recently shown that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a major role in disuse atrophy of soleus, a slow, oxidative muscle. Here we tested the hypothesis that hindlimb unloading-induced atrophy could be due to mitochondrial dysfunction in fast muscles too, notwithstanding their much lower mitochondrial content. Gastrocnemius displayed atrophy following both 3 and 7 days of unloading. SOD1 and catalase up-regulation, no H 2 O 2 accumulation and no increase of protein carbonylation suggest the antioxidant defence system efficiently reacted to redox imbalance in the early phases of disuse. A defective mitochondrial fusion (Mfn1, Mfn2 and OPA1 down-regulation) occurred together with an impairment of OXPHOS capacity. Furthermore, at 3 days of unloading higher acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) phosphorylation was found, suggesting AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway activation. To test the role of mitochondrial alterations we used Tg-mice overexpressing PGC-1α because of the known effect of PGC-1α on stimulation of Mfn2 expression. PGC-α overexpression was sufficient to prevent (i) the decrease of pro-fusion proteins (Mfn1, Mfn2 and OPA1), (ii) activation of the AMPK pathway, (iii) the inducible expression of MuRF1 and atrogin1 and of authopagic factors, and (iv) any muscle mass loss in response to disuse. As the effects of increased PGC-1α activity were sustained throughout disuse, compounds inducing PGC-1α expression could be useful to treat and prevent muscle atrophy also in fast muscles.",,,,,,,Skeletal tissue regulation by catalase over-expression in mitochondria,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4405755/,

This modification occurs at high frequency at position 37 of most tRNAs that decode ANN codons, and stabilizes cognate anticodon–codon interactions. Nearly all genetic studies of the t6A pathway have focused on single-celled organisms. In this study, we report the isolation of an extensive allelic series in the Drosophila ortholog of the core t6A biosynthesis factor Kae1. kae1 hemizygous larvae exhibit decreases in t6A that correlate with allele strength; however, we still detect substantial t6A-modified tRNAs even during the extended larval phase of null alleles. Nevertheless, complementation of Drosophila Kae1 and other t6A factors in corresponding yeast null mutants demonstrates that these metazoan genes execute t6A synthesis. Turning to the biological consequences of t6A loss, we characterize prominent kae1 melanotic masses and show that they are associated with lymph gland overgrowth and ectopic generation of lamellocytes. On the other hand, kae1 mutants exhibit other phenotypes that reflect insufficient tissue growth. Interestingly, whole-tissue and clonal analyses show that strongly mitotic tissues such as imaginal discs are exquisitely sensitive to loss of kae1 , whereas nonproliferating tissues are less affected. Indeed, despite overt requirements of t6A for growth of many tissues, certain strong kae1 alleles achieve and sustain enlarged body size during their extended larval phase.

Neutral pH was selected to minimize hydrolysis of ct6A. tRNA and rRNA were collected as separate fractions, vacuum concentrated and reconstituted in water. tRNA concentrations were determined by UV spectroscopy at 260 nm. In the yeast samples, the proportion of tRNA to ribosomal RNA was much higher so only SEC-HPLC fractionation was required to obtain pure tRNA for analysis. Nucleoside preparation Four micrograms of purified tRNA from each sample was digested using a mixture of Benzonase (21.5 U), bacterial alkaline phosphatase (0.5 U) and phosphodiesterase I (0.21 U) in a final reaction volume of 100 µL. Enzymes were dialyzed into 10 mM ammonium acetate at pH 7 immediately prior to use by washing twice with 10 kDa MWCO Vivaspin 500 spin filters. The reaction mixture was supplemented with MgCl 2 , CaCl 2 , and ZnCl 2 , each at a concentration of 0.1 mM. Nucleobase deaminase inhibitors coformycin and tetrahydrouridine were added at a concentration of 10 µg/mL and 50 µg/mL, respectively, and butylated hydroxytoluene (an antioxidant) was added at a concentration of 0.5 mM. The digestion was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 37°C and was stopped upon removal of the enzymes by microfiltration with 10 kDa spin filters. LC-MS/MS analysis of RNA nucleosides Ribonucleosides were separated using a Synergy Fusion RP, 2.5 µm particle size, 100 Å pore size, 100 mm length, 2 mm inner diameter from Phenomenex, on an Agilent 1290 series HPLC system equipped with a diode array detector. Mobile phase A was 5 mM ammonium acetate and mobile phase B was pure acetonitrile. Gradient elution started with 100% A for 1 min, increased to 10% B after 10 min, 40% after 14 min, 80% after 20 min and regeneration of starting conditions with 100% A for 5 additional minutes. The flow rate was 0.35 mL/min and the column temperature 35°C. The effluent from the column was directed through the DAD before entering the Agilent 6430 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in dynamic multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The MS was operated in positive ion mode with the following parameters: electro-spray ionization (ESI-MS), fragmentor voltage (average) 80 V, cell accelerator voltage 2 V, N 2 -gas temperature 350°C, N 2 -gas flow 10 L/min, nebulizer 40 psi, capillary 3500 V. Modified nucleosides were identified based on having both the correct retention time and mass transition. Under our chromatography conditions, t6A eluted at 8.6 min while ct6A eluted at 6.8 min. Mass transitions were m/z 413 → 281 for t6A and m/z 395 → 263 for ct6A, both corresponding to the neutral loss of ribose. 15 N-2-Deoxyadenosine was added to each sample as an internal standard. Data analysis In each sample, the UV peak areas at 260 nm of the four canonical ribonucleosides—cytidine, uridine, guanosine, and adenosine—were integrated and summed together. Peaks corresponding to detection of MRM transitions for the modified nucleosides were first normalized to the peak area of the internal standard ( 15 N-2-deoxyadenosine) to account for inter-sample detection fluctuations, followed by a second normalization to the summed peak areas of the canonical nucleosides to account for the amount of injected RNA. The adjusted peak areas of the five samples were calculated as a percentage of the corresponding wild-type control sample.",SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL Supplemental material is available for this article.,An extensive allelic series of Drosophila kae1 mutants reveals diverse and tissue-specific requirements for t6A biogenesis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4647464/,

insects widely used in biocontrol, depends on a variety of life history
strategies in conflict with those of their hosts [ 1 ]. Drosophila melanogaster is a natural host of parasitic wasps of the genus Leptopilina .
Attack by L. boulardi ( Lb ), a specialist wasp
to flies of the melanogaster group, activates NF-κB-mediated humoral and
cellular immunity. Inflammatory blood cells mobilize and encapsulate Lb eggs and embryos [ 2 – 5 ]. L. heterotoma ( Lh ), a generalist wasp,
kills larval blood cells and actively suppresses immune responses. Spiked
virus-like particles (VLPs) in wasp venom have clearly been linked to its
successful parasitism of Drosophila [ 6 ], but VLP composition and their biotic
nature have remained mysterious. Our proteomics studies reveal that VLPs lack
viral coat proteins but possess a pharmacopoeia of (a) eukaryotic vesicular
transport system, (b) immunity, and (c) previously unknown proteins. These novel
proteins distinguish Lh from Lb VLPs; notably,
some proteins specific to Lh VLPs possess sequence similarities
with bacterial secretion system proteins. Structure-informed analyses of an
abundant Lh VLP surface/spike-tip protein, p40, reveal
similarities to the needle-tip invasin proteins SipD/IpaD of Gram negative
bacterial type 3 secretion systems that breach immune barriers and deliver
virulence factors into mammalian cells. Our studies suggest that Lh VLPs represent a new class of extracellular organelles
and share pathways for protein delivery with both eukaryotic microvesicles and
bacterial surface secretion systems. Given their mixed prokaryotic/eukaryotic
properties, we propose the term Mixed Strategy Extracellular Vesicles (MSEVs) to
replace VLP.",,,,,,,Novel Organelles with Elements of Bacterial and Eukaryotic Secretion Systems Weaponize Parasites of Drosophila,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5659752/,

Here we use systematic and comprehensive bioinformatics approaches to identify most of the mammalian eicosanoid synthesis enzymes. Sensitive sequence analysis techniques identified candidate Drosophila enzymes that share low global sequence identities with their human counterparts. Twenty Drosophila candidates were selected based upon (a) sequence identity with human enzymes of the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase branches, (b) similar domain architecture and structural conservation of the catalytic domain, and (c) presence of potentially equivalent functional residues. Evaluation of full-length structural models for these 20 top-scoring Drosophila candidates revealed a surprising degree of conservation in their overall folds and potential analogs for functional residues in all 20 enzymes. Although we were unable to identify any suitable candidate for lipoxygenase enzymes, we report structural homology models of three fly cyclooxygenases. Our findings predict that the D . melanogaster genome likely codes for one or more pathways for eicosanoid or eicosanoid-like biolipid synthesis. Our study suggests that classical and/or novel eicosanoids mediators must regulate biological functions in insects–predictions that can be tested with the power of Drosophila genetics.

During oviposition, female wasps introduce venom into the larval hosts’ body cavity. The venom contains discrete, 300 nm-wide, mixed-strategy extracellular vesicles (MSEVs), until recently referred to as virus-like particles. While the crucial immune suppressive functions of L. heterotoma MSEVs have remained undisputed, their biotic nature and origin still remain controversial. In recent proteomics analyses of L. heterotoma MSEVs, we identified 161 proteins in three classes: conserved eukaryotic proteins, infection and immunity related proteins, and proteins without clear annotation. Here we report 246 additional proteins from the L. heterotoma MSEV proteome. An enrichment analysis of the entire proteome supports vesicular nature of these structures. Sequences for more than 90% of these proteins are present in the whole-body transcriptome. Sequencing and de novo assembly of the 460 Mb-sized L. heterotoma genome revealed 90% of MSEV proteins have coding regions within the genomic scaffolds. Altogether, these results explain the stable association of MSEVs with their wasps, and like other wasp structures, their vertical inheritance. While our results do not rule out a viral origin of MSEVs, they suggest that a similar strategy for co-opting cellular machinery for immune suppression may be shared by other wasps to gain advantage over their hosts. These results are relevant to our understanding of the evolution of figitid and related wasp species.",,Materials and Methods,Results and Discussion,Results and Discussion,"Genomes sequencing and assembly Library preparations, sequencing reactions, and associated validations were conducted by GENEWIZ, Inc. (South Plainfield, NJ, USA). Genomic DNA was extracted from ∼50 mg of tissue (∼100 wasps) of Lh males and females separately using mixed bead beating and PureLink Genomic DNA extraction kits following manufacturer’s protocol. Quantification of extracted DNA was performed using Nanodrop and Qubit2.0 Fluorometer (Live Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Integrity of genomic DNA was verified by gel electrophoresis (0.6% agarose). DNA libraries were prepared for each wasp gender by acoustic shearing fragmentation using a Covaris S220. Fragments were end repaired and adenylated prior to adapter ligation on 3′ ends (NEB NextUltra DNA Library Preparation kit, Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Enrichment and indexing of adapter-ligated DNA was done through limited cycle PCR. DNA library validation was performed using TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Libraries were quantified using Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer. Real time PCR (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used to quantify DNA molar mass for each library before multiplexing in equal molar mass. DNA libraries were sequenced using a 2x150 paired-end (PE) configuration on one lane on an Illumina HiSeq 4000. Image analysis and base calling were performed using the HiSeq Control Software (HCS) on the HiSeq instrument. The average size of inserts (without adaptors) in the Illumina library was ∼300-350 bp. De novo assembly of reads and scaffolding of contigs was performed using ABySS 2.2 ( Jackman et al. 2017 ) by the New York Genome Center. De novo assembly of combined male/female genome was performed using Platanus-allee ( Kajitani et al. 2019 ) and scaffolding was improved using AGOUTI ( Zhang et al. 2016 ) on the University of Delaware’s BIOMIX cluster. Sequences from Drosophila -associated bacteria such as Wolbachia spp., Acetobacter pasteurianus , and Lactobacillus plantarum were identified in both assemblies. Wolbachia are endosymbionts of many insects including Leptopilina spp. ( Pannebakker et al. 2004 ; Werren et al. 2008 ; Gueguen et al. 2012 ). Lactobacilli and Acetobacter are symbionts and commensals of sugar-consuming insects ( Crotti et al. 2010 ; Engel and Moran 2013 ). Among the three bacterial species, Wolbachia sequences were the most abundant. BLASTx analysis showed that predicted genes from Wolbachia scaffolds were associated with Wolbachia proteins in GenBank. These bacterial and mitochondrial sequence-containing scaffolds were identified during the NCBI submission process and were manually removed from the submission.","Evaluation of genome assemblies Assemblies made with ABySS and Platanus-allee with AGOUTI were run through QUAST v4.0 ( Mikheenko et al. 2016 ) to determine scaffold number, N50, and GC%. All assemblies were examined for conserved genes and orthologs with BUSCO v9 ( Simão et al. 2015 ; Waterhouse et al. 2017 ) using the Insecta set and training parameters set to “Nasonia”. NCBI BLAST+ (v 2.7.1) was used to compare selected scaffolds produced from male and female genome assemblies ( Johnson et al. 2008 ; Camacho et al. 2009 ). E-value threshold was set at 1x10 −7 . E-values of alignments were considered acceptable if within the range of 0 to 1x10 −10 . K-mer analysis was performed using the K-mer Analysis Toolkit (KAT) ( Mapleson et al. 2016 ) and heat maps were used to compare multiplicity (coverage plus repeats) of K-mers to GC content of the reads, coloring bins according to the number of distinct K-mers in each. This analysis was used to determine whether there were separate clusters of multiplicity/GC content that might arise from different sources, such as contamination. BLAST ( Altschul et al. 1990 ; Camacho et al. 2009 ; Johnson et al. 2008 ) was used to search for homologs of a random sample of genomic scaffolds to which reads from each cluster mapped.

Finally, 27-mer multiplicity/GC content of the scaffolds (9.6 Mb) containing MSEV genes was compared to a random subset of scaffolds (9.6 Mb) without MSEV genes. Statistical differences between Lh 14 and L. clavipes genomes and between MSEV-gene containing scaffolds and non-MSEV-gene containing scaffolds were calculated using a multivariate Cramér test ( Ihaka and Gentleman 1996 ; Baringhaus and Franz 2004 ; Franz 2019 ).",Immune suppressive extracellular vesicle proteins of Leptopilina heterotoma are encoded in the wasp genome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6945029/,

In this study, we demonstrate that Serratia marcescens (strain Db11) was significantly more lethal to Drosophila melanogaster after growth on the International Space Station than ground-based controls, but the increased virulence phenotype of S. marcescens did not persist after the bacterial cultures were passaged on the ground. Increased virulence was also observed in bacteria that were grown in simulated microgravity conditions on the ground using the rotating wall vessel. Increased virulence of the space-flown bacteria was similar in magnitude between wild-type flies and those that were mutants for the well-characterized immune pathways Imd and Toll , suggesting that changes to the host immune system after infection are likely not a major factor contributing towards increased susceptibility of ground-reared flies infected with space-flown bacteria. Characterization of the bacteria shows that at later timepoints spaceflight bacteria grew at a greater rate than ground controls in vitro, and in the host.

They produce extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the venom that are packed with proteins, some of which perform immune suppressive functions. EV interactions with blood cells of host larvae are linked to hematopoietic depletion, immune suppression, and parasite success. But how EVs disperse within the host, enter and kill hematopoietic cells is not well understood. Using an antibody marker for L . heterotoma EVs, we show that these parasite-derived structures are readily distributed within the hosts’ hemolymphatic system. EVs converge around the tightly clustered cells of the posterior signaling center (PSC) of the larval lymph gland, a small hematopoietic organ in Drosophila . The PSC serves as a source of developmental signals in naïve animals. In wasp-infected animals, the PSC directs the differentiation of lymph gland progenitors into lamellocytes. These lamellocytes are needed to encapsulate the wasp egg and block parasite development. We found that L . heterotoma infection disassembles the PSC and PSC cells disperse into the disintegrating lymph gland lobes. Genetically manipulated PSC-less lymph glands remain non-responsive and largely intact in the face of L . heterotoma infection. We also show that the larval lymph gland progenitors use the endocytic machinery to internalize EVs. Once inside, L . heterotoma EVs damage the Rab7- and LAMP-positive late endocytic and phagolysosomal compartments. Rab5 maintains hematopoietic and immune quiescence as Rab5 knockdown results in hematopoietic over-proliferation and ectopic lamellocyte differentiation. Thus, both aspects of anti-parasite immunity, i.e., (a) phagocytosis of the wasp’s immune-suppressive EVs, and (b) progenitor differentiation for wasp egg encapsulation reside in the lymph gland. These results help explain why the lymph gland is specifically and precisely targeted for destruction. The parasite’s simultaneous and multipronged approach to block cellular immunity not only eliminates blood cells, but also tactically blocks the genetic programming needed for supplementary hematopoietic differentiation necessary for host success. In addition to its known functions in hematopoiesis, our results highlight a previously unrecognized phagocytic role of the lymph gland in cellular immunity. EV-mediated virulence strategies described for L . heterotoma are likely to be shared by other parasitoid wasps; their understanding can improve the design and development of novel therapeutics and biopesticides as well as help protect biodiversity.",Introduction,Materials and methods,Results,Discussion,,,A parasitoid wasp of Drosophila employs preemptive and reactive strategies to deplete its host's blood cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8191917/,

The parasitoids produce specialized multi-strategy extracellular vesicle (EV)-like structures in their venom. Proteomic analysis identified several immunity-associated proteins, including the knottin peptide, LhKNOT, containing the structurally conserved inhibitor cysteine knot (ICK) fold, which is present in proteins from diverse taxa. Our structural and docking analysis of LhKNOT’s 36-residue core knottin fold revealed that in addition to the knottin motif itself, it also possesses a Cation–Polar–Cation (CPC) clip. The CPC clip motif is thought to facilitate antimicrobial activity in heparin-binding proteins. Surprisingly, a majority of ICKs tested also possess the CPC clip motif, including 75 bona fide plant and arthropod knottin proteins that share high sequence and/or structural similarity with LhKNOT. Like LhKNOT and these other 75 knottin proteins, even the Drosophila Drosomycin antifungal peptide, a canonical target gene of the fly’s Toll-NF-kappa B immune pathway, contains this CPC clip motif. Together, our results suggest a possible defensive function for the parasitoid LhKNOT. The prevalence of the CPC clip motif, intrinsic to the cysteine knot within the knottin proteins examined here, suggests that the resultant 3D topology is important for their biochemical functions. The CPC clip is likely a highly conserved structural motif found in many diverse proteins with reported heparin binding capacity, including amyloid proteins. Knottins are targets for therapeutic drug development, and insights into their structure–function relationships will advance novel drug design.",1. Introduction,4. Methods,2. Results,3.

However, the effects of viscosity on contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) remain poorly understood. Conventional in vitro culture studies do not reflect the rheological properties of CM. Therefore, we investigated the effects of CM viscosity on renal tubules using a kidney-on-a-chip and two different types of CM. Renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTEC) were cultured in a three-dimensional microfluidic culture platform under bidirectional fluid shear stress. We treated the RPTEC with two types of CM: low- (LOCM, iopromide) and iso-osmolar contrast media (IOCM, iodixanol). Renal tubular cell injury induced by LOCM and IOCM was examined under different iodine concentrations (50–250 mgI/mL) and shear-stress conditions. LOCM showed a significant dose-dependent cytotoxic effect, which was significantly higher than that of IOCM under static and low-to-moderate shear stress conditions. However, high shear-stress resulted in reduced cell viability in IOCM; no difference between IOCM and LOCM was found under high shear-stress conditions. The cytotoxic effects were pronounced at a mean shear stress of 1 dyn/cm 2 or higher. The high viscosity of IOCM slowed the fluid flow rate and augmented fluid shear-stress. We suggest an alternative in vitro model of CIN using the three-dimensional kidney-on-a-chip.

A randomized controlled trial (RCT) research is needed to provide reference, as this concentration can provide satisfactory surgical field clarity while maintaining patients’ hemodynamic stability. Objective Comparison of the effect of subcutaneous injection of different concentrations of epinephrine/physiological saline into EAC under general anesthesia in otoendoscopic surgery on surgical field clarity and hemodynamics. Design This double-blind, RCT study was about the effect of topical epinephrine injection in otoendoscopic surgery. Setting This study was conducted at a single institution. Participants This study included 168 patients conformed to the inclusion criteria. Intervention Patients were randomized to receive different concentrations of epinephrine/physiological saline injection (1:5000, 1:10,000, 1:20,000, or 1:40,000) into the junction of bone and cartilage at posterior wall of EAC during surgery. Main Outcome Measures Surgical field clarity was assessed with surgical field clarity grading scale and tympanic membrane flap flipping time. Hemodynamic changes were monitored by clinical parameters of blood pressure, heart rate, and ST segment of ECG. Results There were no statistically-significant differences in surgical field clarity grade ( P = .577) and tympanic membrane flap flipping time ( P = .490) among 4 concentration groups. Epinephrine injection did cause an increase in hemodynamic parameters when compared with baseline ( P < .05).

Although the mechanisms by which microgravity impairs the spine are unclear, they should be foundational for developing in-flight countermeasures for maintaining astronaut spine health. Because human spine anatomy has adapted to upright posture on Earth, observations of how spaceflight affects the spine should also provide new and potentially important information on spine biomechanics that benefit the general population. PURPOSE: This study compares quantitative measures of lumbar spine anatomy, health, and bio-mechanics in astronauts before and after 6 months of microgravity exposure on board the International Space Station (ISS). STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective longitudinal study. SAMPLE: Six astronaut crewmember volunteers from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) with 6-month missions aboard the ISS comprised our study sample. OUTCOME MEASURES: For multifidus and erector spinae at L3–L4, measures include cross-sectional area (CSA), functional cross-sectional area (FCSA), and FCSA/CSA. Other measures include supine lumbar lordosis (L1–S1), active (standing) and passive (lying) flexion-extension range of motion (FE ROM) for each lumbar disc segment, disc water content from T2-weighted intensity, Pfirrmann grade, vertebral end plate pathology, and subject-reported incidence of chronic low back pain or disc injuries at 1-year follow-up. METHODS: 3T magnetic resonance imaging and dynamic fluoroscopy of the lumbar spine were collected for each subject at two time points: approximately 30 days before launch (pre-flight) and 1 day following 6 months spaceflight on the ISS (post-flight). Outcome measures were compared between time points using paired t tests and regression analyses. RESULTS: Supine lumbar lordosis decreased (flattened) by an average of 11% (p=.019). Active FE ROM decreased for the middle three lumbar discs (L2–L3: −22.1%, p=.049; L3–L4: −17.3%, p=.016; L4–L5: −30.3%, p=.004). By contrast, no significant passive FE ROM changes in these discs were observed (p>.05). Disc water content did not differ systematically from pre- to post-flight. Multifidus and erector spinae changed variably between subjects, with five of six subjects experiencing an average decrease 20% for FCSA and 8%–9% for CSA in both muscles. For all subjects, changes in multifidus FCSA strongly correlated with changes in lordosis (r 2 =0.86, p=.008) and active FE ROM at L4–L5 (r 2 =0.94, p=.007). Additionally, changes in multifidus FCSA/CSA correlated with changes in lordosis (r 2 =0.69, p=.03). Although multifidus-associated changes in lordosis and ROM were present among all subjects, only those with severe, pre-flight end plate irregularities (two of six subjects) had post-flight lumbar symptoms (including chronic low back pain or disc herniation). CONCLUSIONS: We observed that multifidus atrophy, rather than intervertebral disc swelling, associated strongly with lumbar flattening and increased stiffness. Because these changes have been previously linked with detrimental spine biomechanics and pain in terrestrial populations, when combined with evidence of pre-flight vertebral end plate insufficiency, they may elevate injury risk for astronauts upon return to gravity loading. Our results also have implications for deconditioned spines on Earth. We anticipate that our results will inform new astronaut countermeasures that target the multifidus muscles, and research on the role of muscular stability in relation to chronic low back pain and disc injury. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

While unloading causes significant loss of bone mass and density in legs of animals exposed to microgravity, increased blood and interstitial fluid flows accompanying microgravity-induced fluid redistribution may elicit an opposite effect in the head. Seven C57BL/6 mice were randomly chosen for exposure to 15 days of microgravity on the STS-131 mission, while eight littermates served as ground controls. Upon mission completion, all 15 mice calvariae were imaged on a micro-computed tomography scanner. A standardized rectangular volume was placed on the parietal bones of each calvaria for analyses, and three parameters were determined to measure increased parietal bone volume: bone volume (BV), cross-sectional thickness (CsTh), and tissue mineral density (TMD). Microgravity exposure caused a statistically significant increase in BV of the space flight (SF) group compared to the ground control (GC) group – the mean ± SD for SF group was 10.48 ± 0.47 %, compared to 9.64 ± 0.79 % for GC group (p<0.05). CsTh demonstrated a trend of increase from 0.099 ±0.006 mm in the GC group to 0.104 ±0.005 mm in the SF group (p=0.12). TMD was similar between the two groups with 0.878 ±0.029 g/cc for GC and 0.893 ± 0.028 g/cc for SF (p=0.31). Our results indicate that microgravity causes adaptive changes in calvarial bones that do not normally bear weight.

Objective The purpose of this study is to analyze the lumbar spine’s response to backpack loads with upright MRI in ILBP children in order to compare their results to previously published normal child data under the same conditions. We hypothesize that typical backpack loads will have a different effect on the lumbar spine of normal and ILBP children. Summary of Background Data Research in normal children shows that backpack loads compress the lumbar IVDs, increase lumbar coronal deformity, and increase pain. Methods Fifteen pediatric and adolescent patients with ILBP were selected. Patients were excluded if a spinal deformity, an underlying pathology, or known injury was identified. A 0.6T upright MRI scanner imaged the subjects while supine and standing wearing 0 kg, 4 kg, and 8 kg backpacks. IVD height, lumbar lordosis, lumbar coronal deformity, and pain score were recorded after each condition and compared using ANOVAs. We compared the above variables between ILBP and normal subjects using generalized least squares models. Results The cohort’s mean age was 13 ± 3 years. The 4 kg and 8 kg backpacks only compressed the L5-S1 IVD relative to upright with no load. Subjects experienced increasing pain with increasing load. Load had no effect on lumbar lordosis or lumbar coronal deformity. Compared to normal children, ILBP children experience significantly less disc compression at T12-L1 to L4-5, less lumbar lordosis, and more pain with increasing load.

Caudal motion segments from six mice returned from a 30-day Bion M1 mission and eight vivarium controls were loaded to failure in four-point bending. After testing, specimens were processed using histology to determine the location of failure, and adjacent motion segments were scanned with micro-computed tomography (μCT) to quantify bone properties. We observed that spaceflight significantly shortened the nonlinear toe region of the force-displacement curve by 32% and reduced the bending strength by 17%. Flight mouse spinal segments tended to fail within the growth plate and epiphyseal bone, while controls tended to fail at the disc-vertebra junction. Spaceflight significantly reduced vertebral bone volume fraction, bone mineral density, and trabecular thickness, which may explain the tendency of flight specimens to fail within the epiphyseal bone.

Conversely, a gain in bone mass may occur in non-load bearing regions of the body as related to microgravity-induced cephalad fluid shift. Representing non-load bearing regions with mouse calvaria and leveraging the STS-131 (15-day) and BION-M1 (30-day) flights, we examined spatial and temporal calvarial vascular remodeling and gene expression related to microgravity exposure compared between spaceflight (SF) and ground control (GC) cohorts. We examined parasagittal capillary numbers and structures in calvaria from 16 to 23 week-old C57BL/6 female mice (GC, n = 4; SF, n = 5) from STS-131 and 19–20 week-old C57BL/6 male mice (GC, n = 6; SF, n = 6) from BION-M1 using a robust isolectin-IB4 vessel marker. We found that the vessel diameter reduces significantly in mice exposed to 15 days of spaceflight relative to control. Capillarization increases by 30% (SF vs. GC, p = 0.054) in SF mice compared to GC mice. The vessel numbers and diameter remain unchanged in BION-M1 mice calvarial section. We next analyzed the parietal pro-angiogenic ( VEGFA ) and pro-osteogenic gene ( BMP-2, DMP1, RUNX2 and OCN ) expression in BION-M1 mice using quantitative RT-PCR. VEGFA gene expression increased 15-fold while BMP-2 gene expression increased 11-fold in flight mice compared to GC. The linkage between vascular morphology and gene expression in the SF conditions suggests that angiogenesis may be important in the regulation of pathological bone growth in non-weight bearing regions of the body. Short-duration microgravity-mediated bone restructuring has implications in planning effective countermeasures for long-duration flights and extraterrestrial human habitation.",Introduction,Materials and Methods,Results,Discussion,"Discussion Representing non-load bearing regions with mouse calvaria and leveraging the STS-131 (15-day) and BION-M1 (30-day) flights, we examined spatial and temporal calvarial vascular remodeling and gene expression related to microgravity exposure. Unloaded regions of the body such as calvaria show an 30% increase in bone volume when exposed to spaceflight conditions compared to ground controls ( Zhang et al., 2013 ), suggesting differential regulation of load bearing and unloaded regions of the body. Previous work has shown impaired cerebral perfusion and blood distribution based on structural modifications of vessels in the brain due to head-ward fluid shifts in mice exposed to microgravity ( Sofronova et al., 1985 ; Taylor et al., 2013 ). The mechanosensitivity of bone cells to compressive forces and subsequent increase in bone formation in response to mechanical stimuli is known, calvarial adaptations to cephalad fluid shifts, increased intracranial pressure, and cerebrovascular regulation due to microgravity exposure are poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we describe for the first time calvarial vascular morphological alterations in mice exposed to STS-131 conditions, along with angiogenesis and osteogenesis-associated calvarial gene expression changes in mice from BION-M1. Consensus is lacking on the exact effects of microgravity on cerebrovascular regulation as the results from different models are inconsistent. Most of the interpretation of the data is based on patterns derived from other pathologies ( Du et al., 2021 ). Consensus points to fluid redistribution and blood pooling in the brain in the absence of hydrostatic gradients as precipitating the neurological and pathological conditions associated with microgravity. Spaceflight reduces bone mineral density in the lower load-bearing musculoskeletal regions compared to non-load bearing regions such as the skull ( LeBlanc et al., 2000 ; Vico et al., 2000 ; Zhang et al., 2013 ). Mouse skull is a rarely studied structure in spite of its abundance of blood and lymphatic vessels, as well as its structural and functional roles during homeostasis and repair. Calvarial thickness and suture growth is age-dependent and progressive ( Alberius and Johnell, 1990 ). The suture section of the calvarial parietal bone consists of the maximum density of the capillaries which support bone development and is therefore suitable for studying vessel morphology and number. The suture in the calvaria is heavily vascularized with small central vessels ( Alberius and Johnell, 1990 ). Lectin binding to the glycoconjugates of endothelial cells plasmalemma allow for a simple method for the visualization of morphology. Therefore, we used lectin stain to label calvarial blood vessels. Blood vessel diameter is up- or downregulated depending on the intensity and direction of blood flow. Correspondingly, our study demonstrated reductions in calvarial blood vessel diameter in STS-131 S F mice as a response to increase in demands for blood flow and bone volume. Our data showed differential profiles for vessel diameters and numbers in the calvarial sections of mice included on STS-131 (15-day) or BION-M1 (30-day). In STS-131 mice, the vessel diameter was reduced and capillarization increased, a trend suggesting calvarial vessel remodeling and capillarization in the bone trabeculae concomitant to increase in calvarial bone mass identified in early study ( Zhang et al., 2013 ). Clinical and experimental studies have demonstrated a causal link between expression of angiogenic markers and bone formation ( Cackowski et al., 2010 ; Moser et al., 2018 ). During injury or stress, resident suture stem cells secrete VEGF and recruit blood vessels to facilitate repair; VEGF stimulates the proliferation of osteoblast and increased VEGF levels are observed at the proliferative stage of bone repair, and this vascularization is essential for tissue recovery and repair. Insufficient or incongruous formation of bone blood vessels leads to irregular bone formation and increased risk of bone fractures ( Stegen et al., 2015 ). The regeneration of vascular supply through vascularization in parallel with osteogenesis is central in the formation of the new functional bone ( Amini et al., 2012 ). Alterations in VEGFA expression correlates with the number of vessels in spaceflight calvaria in the STS-131 flight mice ( Figure 2B ). Local application of exogenous recombinant BMP2 completely regenerates calvarial defects in a rodent model and is important in tissue healing and restoration. In humans, BMP2 recombinant protein can regenerate mandibular continuity and cleft palate defects ( Boyne, 2001 ; Dickinson et al., 2008 ; Herford and Boyne, 2008 ). BMP-2 addition dramatically increases Osteocalcin (OCN) which in turn is responsible for the pro-osteogenesis function of BMP2. BMP2 induces osteoblast differentiation through RUNX2 expression which directly regulates osteocalcin expression to increase bone formation. RUNX2 is a global regulator of osteogenesis and is crucial for regulating the expression of bone-specific genes. Autocrine BMP production is necessary for the Runx2 transcription factor to be active. Runx2 executes and completes BMP2 signaling for osteoblast differentiation. The co-ordinated activity of Runx2 and BMP2 activated SMADS are critical in bone remodeling and skeleton formation. Taken together, endogenous BMP signaling enhances bone formation and regulation of BMP activity in the postnatal stages is critical for normal bone formation. While acknowledging that there may be site specific and bone dependent differences described by others ( Quarto et al., 2010 ; Kwan et al., 2011 ; Niziolek et al., 2011 ), we show that the parietal region of the mice calvaria are sensitive to fluctuations in fluid shifts and results bone vascular responses. Microgravity-mediated cephalad fluid shift results in high intracranial pressure which may affect vessel morphology. Cerebral vasomotor and mechanical properties, deficiencies in femoral muscle regeneration and defective immune response occurs after 30 days of BION-M1 spaceflight ( Sofronova et al., 1985 ; Andreev-Andrievskiy et al., 2014 ; Markina et al., 2018 ; Radugina et al., 2018 ; Tascher et al., 2019 ). Contrary to this finding, our µCT data of the BION-M1 mice suggests that the calvarial bone structure remain unchanged. However the gene expression of sclerostin, a potent inhibitor of bone formation, is higher in the spaceflight group based on our previous results ( Macaulay et al., 2017 ) implying the possibility of both anabolic and catabolic activity of sclerostin. This is in contrast to previous reports that show that loss of sclerostin increases cranial bone growth and regeneration and sclerostin antibodies are used to increase bone mass in clinical trials of osteoporosis and osteogenesis imperfecta ( Kang et al., 2018 ; Scheiber et al., 2019 ) suggesting that other mechanisms may be involved in bone formation. One of the mechanisms of bone regeneration is the recruitment of stromal and hematopoietic precursors from the bone marrow ( Markina et al., 2018 ). The proliferative capacity of the bone marrow stromal and hematopoietic precursors decreases in the BION-M1 mouse population cohort of mice ( Markina et al., 2018 ) which may explain our findings that the vessel diameter and number of vessels are unchanged in BION-M1 compared to STS-131 ( Figure 2 ). The molecular mechanisms underlying these physiological adaptations of calvarial vessels and bone to cephalad fluid shifts remain poorly understood.","Conclusion This work describes microgravity-associated alterations in pro-angiogenic and pro-osteogenic gene expression in an unloaded bone region in two wild-type study populations. These results suggest skull vasculature and bone as a sensor for gravity and cephalad fluid shifts, outcomes that highlight the importance of the development of countermeasures for long-duration spaceflight. An in-depth, gender-based study of mouse calvaria that includes genomic, proteomic and metabolomic components will further characterize pathways involved in the increase in calvaria growth seen in study populations exposed to microgravity. Future study will also examine the behavior of BMP-2 gene expression levels post-flight, and whether these levels return to baseline prior to euthanasia. These results also suggest that key molecules associated with angiogenesis (VEGFA) and osteogenesis (BMP-2) genes are modulated in BION-M1 mice calvaria exposed to 30 days of microgravity. We suggest that VEGFA and BMP-2 genes are gravity sensors in mouse calvaria. The finding is relevant in the development of countermeasures for prolonged crewed spaceflight and to understand the molecular and structural adaptations of bone and vasculature to the microgravity environment. Lastly, there is a need to monitor the entire astronaut skeletal system on a meta-scale and in a spatio-temporal manner; this type of inquiry will leverage the site-specific, heterogenic skeletal responses and the sufficiency of short-term microgravity exposure to induce upregulation of angiogenic and osteogenic gene expression.",Spaceflight-associated vascular remodeling and gene expression in mouse calvaria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9139491/,

M. marinum were grown in high aspect ratio vessels (HARVs) using a rotary cell culture system subjected to LSMMG or the control orientation (normal gravity, NG) and the cultures used to determine bacterial growth, bacterium size, transcriptome changes, and resistance to stress. Two exposure times to LSMMG and NG were examined: bacteria were grown for ~40 h (short), or 4 days followed by re-dilution and growth for ~35 h (long). M. marinum exposed to LSMMG transitioned from exponential phase earlier than the NG culture. They were more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide but showed no change in resistance to gamma radiation or pH 3.5. RNA-Seq detected significantly altered transcript levels for 562 and 328 genes under LSMMG after short and long exposure times, respectively. Results suggest that LSMMG induced a reduction in translation, a downregulation of metabolism, an increase in lipid degradation, and increased chaperone and mycobactin expression.

PCA revealed 61% (PC1) and 15% (PC2) of the total variance with substantial positive relationships and high loading conditions on all germination attributes on PC1 with greater PC1 scores for PEG treatments showing the increased germination indices in PEG-treated seeds among all the priming treatments tested. All 13 distinct priming treatments tried clustered into three groups as per Ward's approach of systematic categorization, clustering the third group showing relatively poor germination performances. Most germination traits exhibited statistically significant associations at the p < 0.01 level. Overall, the results established the usefulness of the different priming approaches facilitating better germination, survival, and resistance against salinity in the cauliflower to be used further before sowing in the salt-affected agro-ecosystems.",Introduction,,Results,Discussion,,Conclusion and future prospective,Oxygen dependency of germinating Brassica seeds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10025027/,

We subjected hydrated Pleopeltis polypodioides fronds to temperatures up to 50°C and dehydrated fronds up to 65°C for 24 h. The effect of heat stress was evaluated using morphological changes, photosystem (PS) II efficiency, and metabolic indicators. Pinnae of dried fronds exposed to more than 40°C curled tighter and became brittle compared to fronds dried at lower temperatures. Exposure to > 50°C leads to discolored fronds after rehydration. Hydrated fronds turned partially brown at > 35°C. Chlorophyll fluorescence (F t ) and quantum yield (Q y ) increased following re-hydration but the recovery process after 40°C treatment lasted longer than at lower temperatures. Similarly, hydrated fronds showed reduced Q y when exposed to > 40°C. Dried and hydrated fronds remained metabolically active up to 40°C. Hydroperoxides and lipid hydroperoxides in dried samples remained high up to 50°C, but decreased in hydrated fronds at > 40°C. Catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH) oxidizing activities remained high up to 40°C in dehydrated fronds and up to 35°C in hydrated fronds. Major fatty acids detected in both dehydrated and hydrated fronds included palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) acids, oleic (18:1), linoleic (C18:2); and linolenic (C18:3) acids. Linolenic acid was most abundant. In dried fronds, all fatty acids decreased at > 35°C. The combined data indicate that the thermotolerance of dry fronds is about 55°C but is at least 10°C lower for hydrated fronds.",Introduction,Materials and Methods,Results,Discussion,,Conclusion,"Desiccation mitigates heat stress in the resurrection fern, Pleopeltis polypodioides",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7733933/,

This positive curvature occurs at the base of the hypocotyl and is followed by the typical negative gravity-induced curvature. We investigated the role of auxin in both positive and negative hypocotyl curvature by examining the transcription of PIN1 , PIN3 , IAA5 and ARG1 in curving tissue. We compared tissue extraction of the convex and concave flank with Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE). Based on Ubiquitin1 ( UBQ1 ) as a reference gene, the log (2) fold change of all examined genes was determined. Transcription of the examined genes varied during the graviresponse suggesting that these genes affect differential elongation. The transcription of all genes was upregulated in the lower flank and downregulated in the upper flank during the initial downward curving period. After 48 h, the transcription profile reversed, suggesting that the ensuing negative gravicurvature is controlled by the same genes as the positive gravicurvature. High-spatial resolution profiling using SPGE revealed that the transcription profile of the examined genes was spatially distinct within the curving tissue. The comparison of the hypocotyl transcription profile with the root tip indicated that the tip tissue is a suitable reference for curving hypocotyls and that root and hypocotyl curvature are controlled by the same physiological processes.",1.

Both gravi- and phototropism determine directional growth and previous experiments showed that high gradient magnetic fields (HGMF) can induce curvature in roots and shoots. Experiments with Brassica rapa verified that that gravitropism-like induction of curvature is possible in space and that the HGMF-responsive organelles are amyloplasts. We assessed the effect of space and HGMF based on 16 genes and compared their transcription with static growth and clinorotation. Amyloplasts size in root tips increased under weightlessness but decreased under clinorotation but not in response to magnetic fields. Amyloplast size changes were correlated with reduced amylase transcription in space samples and enhanced transcription after clinorotation. Mechanostimulation and weightlessness have opposite effects on the size of amyloplasts. The data show that plants perceive weightlessness, and that their metabolism adjusts to microgravity and mechanostimulation. Thus, clinorotation as surrogate for space research may lead to incorrect interpretations.",Introduction,Material and methods,Results and discussion,Results and discussion,,,High-gradient magnetic fields and starch metabolism: Results from a space experiment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9617909/,

The cell membrane participates in numerous processes, including endo- and exocytosis and cell division, and is involved in the response to external stimuli. Variable but stabilized microdomains form in membranes that include specific lipids and proteins that became known as (detergent-resistant) membrane microdomains, or lipid rafts with various subclassifications. The composition, especially the sterol-dependent recruitment of specific proteins affects endo- and exo-membrane domains as well as plasmodesmata. The enhanced saturated fatty acid content in lipid rafts after clinorotation suggests increased rigidity and reduced membrane permeability as a primary response to abiotic and mechanical stress. These results can also be obtained with lipid-sensitive stains. The linkage of the CM to the cytoskeleton via rafts is part of the complex interactions between lipid microdomains, mechanosensitive ion channels, and the organization of the cytoskeleton. These intricately linked structures and functions provide multiple future research directions to elucidate the role of lipid rafts in physiological processes.",1. Introduction,,,,,5.

One mechanism for the perception of force is the activation of mechanosensitive (or stretch-activated) ion channels, and a number of mechanosensitive channel activities have been described in plant membranes. Based on their homology to the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscS, the 10 MscS-Like (MSL) proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana have been hypothesized to form mechanosensitive channels in plant cell and organelle membranes. However, definitive proof that MSLs form mechanosensitive channels has been lacking. Here we used single-channel patch clamp electrophysiology to show that MSL10 is capable of providing a MS channel activity when heterologously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. This channel had a conductance of ∼100 pS, consistent with the hypothesis that it underlies an activity previously observed in the plasma membrane of plant root cells. We found that MSL10 formed a channel with a moderate preference for anions, which was modulated by strongly positive and negative membrane potentials, and was reversibly inhibited by gadolinium, a known inhibitor of mechanosensitive channels. MSL10 demonstrated asymmetric activation/inactivation kinetics, with the channel closing at substantially lower tensions than channel opening. The electrophysiological characterization of MSL10 reported here provides insight into the evolution of structure and function of this important family of proteins.",,,,,,,Expression and characterization of the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscS in Xenopus laevis oocytes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3503204/,

While recent studies have identified distinct populations of A mechanonociceptors (AMs) that are required for mechanical pain, the molecular underpinnings of mechanonociception remain unknown. Here, we show that the bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and S1P Receptor 3 (S1PR3) are critical regulators of acute mechanonociception. Genetic or pharmacological ablation of S1PR3, or blockade of S1P production, significantly impaired the behavioral response to noxious mechanical stimuli, with no effect on responses to innocuous touch or thermal stimuli. These effects are mediated by fast-conducting A mechanonociceptors, which displayed a significant decrease in mechanosensitivity in S1PR3 mutant mice. We show that S1PR3 signaling tunes mechanonociceptor excitability via modulation of KCNQ2/3 channels. Our findings define a new role for S1PR3 in regulating neuronal excitability and establish the importance of S1P/S1PR3 signaling in the setting of mechanical pain thresholds.",Introduction,Materials and methods,Results,Discussion,"Materials and methods Key resources table Reagent type (species) or resource Designation Source or reference Identifiers Additional information strain, strain background (C57BL/6J) C57BL/6J; WT; wild-type The Jackson Laboratory Jackson Stock #: 000664; RRID: IMSR_JAX:000664 strain, strain background (B6.129S6- S1pr3tm1Rlp/Mmnc) S1PR3 KO; S1pr3-/- MMRRC Repository; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15138255 ; PMID: 15138255 B6.129S6-S1pr3tm1Rlp/ Mmnc; MMRRC Stock #: 012038-UNC; RRID: MMRRC_012038-UNC strain, strain background (B6.Cg- S1pr3tm1.1Hrose/J) S1pr3-mCherry; S1pr3mcherry/+ The Jackson Laboratory B6.Cg-S1pr3tm1.1Hrose/J; Jackson Stock #: 028624; RRID: IMSR_JAX:028624 antibody (Living Colors DsRed Rabbit Polyclonal Antibody) Rabbit anti-DsRed Clontech RRID: AB_10013483 ; Cat # 632496 antibody (Chicken polyclonal to Neurofilament heavy polypeptide) Chicken anti-NefH Abcam RRID: AB_304560 ; Cat # ab4680 antibody (Chicken polyclonal to beta III Tubulin) Chicken anti-β-tubulin III Abcam RRID: AB_10899689 ; Cat # ab107216 antibody (Mouse monoclonal [13C4/I3 C4] to PGP9.5) Mouse anti-PGP9.5 Abcam RRID: AB_306343 ; Cat # ab8189 antibody (Rabbit polyclonal to EDG3) Rabbit anti-S1PR3 Abcam RRID: AB_732070 ; Cat # ab38324 antibody (Mouse monoclonal to NF200) Mouse anti-NF200 Sigma-Aldrich RRID: AB_260781 ; Cat # N5389 antibody (Chicken polyclonal to Peripherin) Chicken anti-Peripherin Abcam RRID: AB_777207 ; Cat # ab39374 antibody (Goat Anti-Mouse IgG H and L Alexa Fluor 488) Goat anti-Mouse Alexa 488 Abcam RRID: AB_2688012 ; Cat # ab150117 antibody (Goat anti-Chicken IgY (H + L) Secondary Antibody, Alexa Fluor 488) Goat anti-Chicken Alexa 488 ThermoFisher Scientific RRID: AB_2534096 ; Cat # A-11039 antibody (Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L) Secondary Antibody, Alexa Fluor 594) Goat anti-Rabbit Alexa 594 Invitrogen RRID: AB_2556545 ; Cat # R37117 sequence-based reagent S1pr3 Type I Probe ThermoFisher Scientific; Affymetrix Assay ID: VB1-19668-VC sequence-based reagent Scn1a Type 6 Probe ThermoFisher Scientific; Affymetrix Assay ID: VB6-18173-VC sequence-based reagent Npy2r Type 6 Probe ThermoFisher Scientific; Affymetrix Assay ID: VB6-3197254-VC sequence-based reagent Piezo2 Type 6 Probe ThermoFisher Scientific; Affymetrix Assay ID: VB6-18046-VC sequence-based reagent Trpv1 Type 6 Probe ThermoFisher Scientific; Affymetrix Assay ID: VB6-18246-VC sequence-based reagent Trpa1 Type 6 Probe ThermoFisher Scientific; Affymetrix Assay ID: VB6-16610-VC commercial assay or kit (ViewRNA ISH Tissue Assay Kit (2-plex)) ViewRNA ISH Tissue Assay Kit ThermoFisher Scientific; Affymetrix Cat # QVT0012 chemical compound, drug (Sphingosine-1-phosphate) Sphingosine 1-phosphate; S1P Tocris Bioscience; Avanti Polar Lipids CAS 26993-30-6; Cat # 1370; Cat # 860641 chemical compound, drug (TY 521256) TY 52156 Tocris Bioscience CAS 934369-14-9; Cat # 5328 chemical compound, drug (SKI II) SKI II Tocris Bioscience CAS 312636-16-1; Cat # 2097 chemical compound, drug (Histamine dihydrochloride) Histamine Sigma-Aldrich CAS 56-92-8; Cat # H7250 chemical compound, drug (Chloroquine diphosphate) Chloroquine Sigma-Aldrich CAS 50-63-5; Cat # C6628 chemical compound, drug (E-Capsaicin) Capsaicin Tocris Bioscience CAS 404-86-4; Cat # 0462 chemical compound, drug (Dimethyl sulfoxide) DMSO Sigma-Aldrich Cat # 8418–100 mL chemical compound, drug (Methanol) Methanol Sigma-Aldrich CAS 67-56-1; Cat # 34860 chemical compound, drug (Linopirdine dihydrochloride) Linopirdine Tocris Bioscience CAS 113168-57-3; Cat # 1999 chemical compound, drug (XE 991 dihydrochloride) XE 991 Tocris Bioscience CAS 122955-13-9; Cat # 2000 chemical compound, drug (W146) W146 Tocris Bioscience CAS 909725-61-7; Cat # 3602 chemical compound, drug (Freund's Adjuvant, Complete) Complete Freund's Adjuvant; CFA Sigma-Aldrich Cat # F5881 chemical compound, drug (Formaldehyde, 16%, methanol free, Ultra Pure) Paraformaldehyde; PFA Polysciences, Inc.

Wherever possible, wild-type/heterozygous ( S1pr3) littermate controls were used in behavioral experiments. Mice (20–25 g) were housed in 12 hr light-dark cycle at 21°C. Mice were singly housed one week prior to all behavioral experiments and were between 8–10 weeks at the time of the experiment. All mice were acclimated in behavioral chambers (IITC Life Sciences) on two subsequent days for 1 hr prior to all behavioral experiments. Itch and acute pain behavioral measurements were performed as previously described ( Morita et al., 2015 ; Wilson et al., 2013 ; Tsunozaki et al., 2013 ). Mice were shaved one week prior to itch behavior. Compounds injected: 500 µM TY 52156 (Tocris), 50 µM SKI II (Tocris), 0.2–10 µM S1P (Tocris, Avanti Polar Lipids), 50 mM chloroquine (Sigma), and 27 mM histamine (Tocris) in PBS with either 0.01–0.1% Methanol- (S1P) or 0.1–0.5% DMSO-PBS (all other compounds) vehicle controls. Pruritogens were injected using the cheek model (20 µL) of itch, as previously described ( Shimada and LaMotte, 2008 ). Behavioral scoring was performed while blind to experimental condition and mouse genotype. All scratching and wiping behavior videos were recorded for 1 hr. Itch behavior was scored for the first 30 min and acute pain was scored for the first five minutes. Bout number and length were recorded. For radiant heat and von Frey hypersensitivity behavior, drugs were injected intradermally into the plantar surface of the hindpaw (20 µL). Radiant heat assays were performed using the IITC Life Science Hargreaves test system. Mechanical threshold was measured using calibrated von Frey monofilaments (Touch Test) on a metal grate platform (IITC). Von Frey was performed as previously described ( Tsunozaki et al., 2013 ; Chaplan et al., 1994 ) using the up-down method ( Dixon, 1965 ) while blinded to compound injected and genotype, or a descending force-series of 4 trials per force from 0.4 g to 6 g. Valid responses for both von Frey and radiant heat included fast paw withdrawal, licking/biting/shaking of the affected paw, or flinching. For radiant heat and von Frey, mice were allowed to acclimate on platform for 1 hr before injection. Measurements were taken 15 min pre-injection and 20–30 min post-injection for all compounds used. The pinprick assay ( Duan et al., 2014 ) was conducted on a von Frey testing platform (IITC). The mouse hindpaw was poked with a 31 g syringe needle without breaking the skin to induce fast acute mechanical pain. Each paw was stimulated 10 times with the needle, with five minutes rest in between trials, and the % withdrawal (fast withdrawal, licking/biting/shaking of paw, squeaking, and/or flinching) was calculated from the total number of trials. The tape assay was conducted according to previously described methods ( Ranade et al., 2014 ). Number of attempts to remove a 3 cm piece of lab tape was recorded for 10 min after manual tape application to the rostral back. Scorer and experimenter were blinded to genotype. For righting reflex measurements, age-matched S1pr3 -/- and +/+ P6-7 neonates were used. Briefly, pups were overturned one at a time on the home cage lid while experimenter was blinded to genotype. The time to righting was measured to the nearest 1/10 th of a second with a stopwatch. For the CFA model of hypersensitivity, mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane (2%) and injected with 15 µL CFA (Sigma) into one hindpaw using a Hamilton syringe (30 g) at 5pm. Radiant heat latencies and von Frey 50% withdrawal thresholds were recorded one day prior to CFA, the morning of CFA (prior to injection), and one and two days post-CFA. Von Frey measurements were acquired before radiant heat latencies, and mice were allowed a one-hour recovery period in home cage with access to food and water in between testing. Both ipsilateral and contralateral paw were measured. Experimenter was blind to genotype for injections and recording. All behavior experiments were carried out using age-matched or littermate cohorts of male mice and conducted between 8 am and 1 pm. Mice were tested in 4-part behavior chambers (IITC Life Sciences) with opaque dividers (TAP Plastics) with the exception of righting reflex measurements. Scratching and wiping behaviors were filmed from below using high-definition cameras. All experiments were performed under the policies and recommendations of the International Association for the Study of Pain and approved by the University of California, Berkeley Animal Care and Use Committee. In situ hybridization (ISH) Fresh DRG were dissected from 8 to 12 week old mice, flash frozen in OCT embedding medium, and sectioned at 14 μm onto slides. ISH was performed using Affymetrix Quantigene ViewISH Tissue 2-plex kit according to manufacturer’s instructions with Type 1 ( S1pr3 ) and Type 6 (all other) probes. The following probes against mouse mRNAs were created by Affymetrix and used for ISH: S1pr3, Scn1a, Npy2r, Piezo2, Trpv1, Trpa1. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of DRG DRG were dissected from 8 to 12 week old adult mice and post-fixed in 4% PFA for one hour. DRG were cryo-protected overnight at 4°C in 30% sucrose-PBS, embedded in OCT, and then cryosectioned at 12 μm onto slides. Briefly, slides were washed 3x in PBST (0.3% Triton X-100), blocked in 2.5% horse serum +2.5% BSA PBST, and incubated overnight at 4°C in 1:1000 primary antibody in PBST +0.5% horse serum +0.5% BSA. Slides were washed 3X in PBS then incubated 1–2 hr at RT in 1:1000 secondary antibody. Slides were washed 3X in PBS and mounted in Fluoromount-G +DAPI with No. 1.5 coverglass. Primary antibodies used: Rabbit anti-DsRed (Clontech #632496), Rabbit anti-S1PR3 (Abcam #38324; #108370), Mouse anti-NF200 (Sigma #N5389), Chicken anti-Peripherin (Abcam #39374). Secondary antibodies used: Goat anti-Mouse Alexa 488 (Abcam #150117), Goat anti-Chicken Alexa 488 (ThermoFisher #A11039), Goat anti-Rabbit Alexa 594 (Invitrogen # R37117 ). Isolectin B4 (IB4)-FITC (Enzo Life Sciences #ALX-650–001F-MC05) was also used. Slides were mounted in Fluoromount with No. 1.5 coverglass. Imaging of DRG ISH and IHC experiments, and all live-cell imaging, was performed on an Olympus IX71 microscope with a Lambda LS-xl light source (Sutter Instruments). For DRG ISH and IHC analysis, images were analyzed using FIJI software. Briefly, DAPI-positive cells were circled and their fluorescence intensity (AFU) for all channels was plotted against cell size using Microsoft Excel software. Co-labeling analysis was performed using FIJI. Intensity thresholds were set based on the negative control (no probe) slide. Cells were defined as co-expressing if their maximum intensities exceeded the threshold for both channels of interest. IHC of sectioned skin Skin was dissected from 8 week old adult mice and post-fixed in 4% PFA for 30 min at RT. DRG were cryo-protected overnight at 4°C in 30% sucrose-PBS, embedded in OCT, and then sectioned at 18 μm onto slides. Briefly, slides were blocked in 5% normal goat serum in PBST (0.1% Triton X-100) and incubated overnight at 4°C in 1:1000 primary antibody in blocking buffer. Slides were washed 3X in PBS then incubated 45 min at RT in 1:1000 secondary antibody. Slides were washed 5X in PBS and mounted in Fluoromount-G +DAPI with No. 1.5 coverglass. Primary antibodies used: Rabbit anti-DsRed (Clontech #632496), Chicken anti-NefH (Abcam #4680), Chicken anti-β-tubulin III (Abcam #107216), mouse anti-PGP9.5 (Abcam #8189). Secondary antibodies used: Goat anti-Mouse Alexa 488 (Abcam #150117), Goat anti-Rabbit Alexa 594 (Invitrogen # R37117 ), Goat anti-Chicken Alexa 488 (ThermoFisher #A11039). For co-localization analysis, only fibers for which >50% of the length of the visible fiber contained co-localized (white) pixels were counted. Image analysis was performed using FIJI. Whole mount skin IHC Staining was performed according to Marshall et al. (2016) . Briefly, 8-week-old mice were euthanized and the back skin was shaved, depilated, and tape-stripped. The removed skin was fixed overnight in 4% PFA, then washed in PBS (3X for 10 min each). Dermal fat was scraped away with a scalpel and skin was washed in PBST (0.3% Triton X-100; 3X for two hours each) then incubated in 1:500 primary antibody (Rabbit anti DsRed: Clontech #632496; Chicken anti-Nefh: Abcam #4680) in blocking buffer (PBST with 5% goat serum and 20% DMSO) for 5.5 days at 4°C. Skin was washed as before and incubated in 1:500 secondary antibody (Goat anti-Rabbit Alexa 594; Invitrogen # R37117 ; Goat anti-Chicken Alexa 488; ThermoFisher #A11039) in blocking buffer for 3 days at 4°C. Skin was washed in PBST, serially dried in methanol: PBS solutions, incubated overnight in 100% methanol, and finally cleared with a 1:2 solution of benzyl alcohol: benzyl benzoate (BABB; Sigma) before mounting between No. 1.5 coverglass. Sectioned and whole mount skin samples were imaged on a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope with OPO using a 20x water objective. Image analysis was performed using FIJI. Cell culture Cell culture was carried out as previously described ( Wilson et al., 2011 ). Briefly, neurons from dorsal root ganglia (2–8 week old adults) or trigeminal ganglia (P0) were dissected and incubated for 10 min in 1.4 mg ml−1 Collagenase P (Roche) in Hanks calcium-free balanced salt solution, followed by incubation in 0.25% standard trypsin (vol/vol) STV versene-EDTA solution for 2 min with gentle agitation. Cells were then triturated, plated onto Poly D-Lysine coated glass coverslips and used within 20 hr. Media: MEM Eagle's with Earle's BSS medium, supplemented with 10% horse serum (vol/vol), MEM vitamins, penicillin/streptomycin and L-glutamine. Calcium imaging Ca 2+ imaging experiments were carried out as previously described ( Wilson et al., 2011 ). Cells were loaded for 60 min at room temperature with 10 µM Fura-2AM supplemented with 0.01% Pluronic F-127 (wt/vol, Life Technologies) in a physiological Ringer’s solution containing (in mM) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2 and 10 D-(+)-glucose, pH 7.4. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Acquired images were displayed as the ratio of 340 nm/ 380 nm. Cells were identified as neurons by eliciting depolarization with high potassium Ringer’s solution (75 mM) at the end of each experiment. Responding neurons were defined as those having a > 15% increase from baseline ratio. Image analysis and statistics were performed using automated routines in Igor Pro (WaveMetrics). Fura-2 ratios were normalized to the baseline ratio F340/F380 = (Ratio)/(Ratio t = 0). In vitro electrophysiology Electrophysiological experiments were carried out as previously described ( Wilson et al., 2011 ). Briefly, recordings were collected at 5 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz (Axopatch 200B, pClamp software). Electrode resistance ranged between 1.5–5 MΩ. Internal solution contained 140 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM HEPES, 1 mM Na2ATP, 100 µM GTP, and 100 µM cAMP (pH 7.4). Bath solution was physiological Ringer’s solution. The pipette potential was canceled before seal formation. Cell capacitance was canceled before whole cell voltage-clamp recordings. For mechanonociceptors experiments, only cells which were visually identified as mCherry expressing and which had a capacitance between 40–80 pF were used. Rheobase was calculated as the smallest current step required to elicit an action potential using current steps of 50 pA. M currents were measured and analyzed using standard protocols for DRG neurons reported in the literature ( Schütze et al., 2016 ; Crozier et al., 2007 ; Zheng et al., 2013 ). Experiments were carried out only on cells with a series resistance of less than 30 MΩ. Analysis of electrophysiology data was performed in pClamp and IgorPro. Ex vivo skin-nerve electrophysiology Touch-evoked responses in the skin were recorded after dissecting the hind limb skin and saphenous nerve from 7 to 10 week old mice, according to published methods ( Wellnitz et al., 2010 ; Maksimovic et al., 2014 ). The skin was placed epidermis-side-up in a custom chamber and perfused with carbogen-buffered synthetic interstitial fluid (SIF) kept at 32°C with a temperature controller (model TC-344B, Warner Instruments). The nerve was kept in mineral oil in a recording chamber, teased apart, and placed onto a gold recording electrode connected with a reference electrode to a differential amplifier (model 1800, A-M Systems). The extracellular signal was digitized using a PowerLab 8/35 board (AD Instruments) and recorded using LabChart software (AD Instruments). For these studies, we focused on A-mechanonociceptors (AMs). To identify responses from these afferents in mutant and control genotypes, we used a mechanical search paradigm with a fine glass probe. Afferents were classified as AMs according to the following criteria: (1) conduction velocity (approximately, one to (≤12 m/ s −1 ), (2) medium-sized receptive fields, (3) sustained response to mechanical indentation ( Wellnitz et al., 2010 ; Koltzenburg, 1997 ; Zimmermann et al., 2009 ). Touch-sensitive afferents that did not meet these criteria were not analyzed further. Responses were classified as Adapting AMs if the ratio of mean firing rate in the dynamic phase of stimulation (first 0.2 s) to the static phase of stimulation (last 4.8 s) was greater than 2, and Non-Adapting AMs if the ratio was less than or equal to 2. Non-responders ( Figure 6F ) responded to suprathreshold mechanical stimulation with von Frey monofilaments (tip diameter <0.5 mm), but not to maximal controlled mechanical stimulation (256 mN, tip diameter 2 mm). All recordings and analyses were performed blind to genotype. Mechanical responses were elicited with von Frey monofilaments and a force controlled custom-built mechanical stimulator. Mechanical thresholds were defined as the lowest von Frey monofilament to reliable elicit at least on action potential. Force controlled mechanical stimuli were delivered using a computer controlled, closed-loop, mechanical stimulator (Model 300C-I, Aurora Scientific, 2 mm tip diameter). Low-pass filtered, 5 s long, length control steps (square wave) simultaneously delivered with permissive force control steps (square wave) were generated using LabChart software (AD Instruments). An arbitrarily selected force step-and-hold protocol (8, 32, 4, 64, 128, 16, 256 mN) was delivered to all fibers. The period between successive displacements was 60 s. Conduction velocity was measured by electrically stimulating identified receptive fields. Spike sorting by principal component analysis (PCA) and density based clustering, and data analysis was performed off-line with custom-made software in MATLAB. Statistics were performed in Prism. Flow cytometry of CFA-treated hind paws CFA injections were performed as described above. Briefly, hindpaw skin and underlying fascia of treated and PBS-injected paws were removed from freshly euthanized mice. Skin was placed in RPMI media (Gibco) on ice before mincing with dissection scissors. Digestions were performed for 90 min at 37°C on a rotating platform in 1 mL RPMI supplemented with 1:1000 DNaseI enzyme (Roche) and one unit LiberaseTM (Roche). Skin was then filtered through 70 µm nylon mesh (Falcon), washed in RPMI, and resuspended in PBS for Aqua Live-Dead staining. Samples were then transferred to FACS buffer (PBS with 0.5% FBS and 2 mM EDTA), blocked, then surface stained with the following antibodies: cKit-Biotin, FceRI-PE, CD49b-PECy7, SiglecF-APC, SA-FITC, Ly6C-PerCP, CD11b-PB, Ly6G-BV785, CD45.2-AF700. Compensation tubes (single-stain) were prepared for each fluorophore using positive and negative control beads. A spleen from a wild-type animal was also prepared by crushing between frosted glass slides, straining through 70 µm nylon mesh, and lysing of erythrocytes in ACK (Gibco). A portion of spleen sample was heat-killed for 10 min at 65°C and stained with Aqua viability stain and set aside. The rest of the spleen was stained normally with the other skin samples. Samples were then run through a flow cytometer (BD Fortessa). Data were analyzed using FlowJo (Prism) and Microsoft Excel. Neutrophils were defined as live single cells with the following staining profile: CD45.2 + /CD11b + /Ly6G + /Ly6C + . Inflammatory monocytes were defined as the following: CD45.2 + /CD11b + /Ly6G - /Ly6C high . Total number of immune cells was reported, rather than percentage of total, since neither genotype differed significantly in total number of live cells or total number of CD45.2 + immune cells. Statistical analyses All statistical analyses, except for skin nerve data (see above), were performed using IgorPro software or Microsoft Excel. Values are reported as the mean ±SEM where multiple independent experiments are pooled and reported (for whole cell electrophysiology), and mean ±SD where one experiment was performed with multiple wells (for calcium imaging) or mice (for behavior). For comparison between two groups, Student’s unpaired 2-tailed t-test was used. A paired t-test was employed only for measurements within the same biological replicate and after a given treatment. For single-point comparison between >2 groups, a one-way ANOVA followed by appropriate post hoc test was used, depending on comparison. For the time course comparison between two groups, 2-way ANOVA was used and single comparison p-values were derived using Tukey’s HSD or appropriate statistical test, depending on comparison. Number of mice or samples required to attain significance was not calculated beforehand, and where multiple statistical tests were performed, a Bonferroni correction was applied. In figure legends, significance was labeled as: n.s., not significant, p≥0.05; *p<0.05; **p<0.01; ***p<0.001.","Additional information Competing interests No competing interests declared.

Concurrently, cellular differentiation in the developing shoot is coordinated with the environmental and developmental status of plastids within those cells. Here, we employ an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant exhibiting constitutive plastid osmotic stress to investigate the molecular and genetic pathways connecting plastid osmotic stress with cell differentiation at the shoot apex. msl2 msl3 mutants exhibit dramatically enlarged and deformed plastids in the shoot apical meristem, and develop a mass of callus tissue at the shoot apex. Callus production in this mutant requires the cytokinin receptor AHK2 and is characterized by increased cytokinin levels, downregulation of cytokinin signaling inhibitors ARR7 and ARR15, and induction of the stem cell identity gene WUSCHEL . Furthermore, plastid stress-induced apical callus production requires elevated plastidic reactive oxygen species, ABA biosynthesis, the retrograde signaling protein GUN1, and ABI4. These results are consistent with a model wherein the cytokinin/WUS pathway and retrograde signaling control cell differentiation at the shoot apex.",,,,,,,Plastid osmotic stress influences cell differentiation at the plant shoot apex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5047659/,

Background: Ground-based microgravity simulation can reproduce the apparent effects of weightlessness in spaceflight using clinostats that continuously reorient the gravity vector on a specimen, creating a time-averaged nullification of gravity. In this work, we investigated the effects of clinorotation speed on the morphology, cytoarchitecture, and migration behavior of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Methods: We compared cell responses at clinorotation speeds of 0, 30, 60, and 75 rpm over 8 h in a recently developed lab-on-chip-based clinostat system. Time-lapse light microscopy was used to visualize changes in cell morphology during and after cessation of clinorotation. Cytoarchitecture was assessed by actin and vinculin staining, and chemotaxis was examined using time-lapse light microscopy of cells in NGF (100 ng/ml) gradients. Results: Among clinorotated groups, cell area distributions indicated a greater inhibition of cell spreading with higher angular frequency ( P <0.005), though average cell area at 30 rpm after 8 h became statistically similar to control ( P =0.794). Cells at 75 rpm clinorotation remained viable and were able to re-spread after clinorotation. In chemotaxis chambers, clinorotation did not alter migration patterns in elongated cells, but most clinorotated cells exhibited cell retraction, which strongly compromised motility. Conclusions: These results indicate that hMSCs respond to clinorotation by adopting more rounded, less-spread morphologies. The angular frequency-dependence suggests that a cell’s ability to sense the changing gravity vector is governed by the rate of perturbation. For migration studies, cells cultured in clinorotated chemotaxis chambers were generally less motile and exhibited retraction instead of migration.",Introduction,Methods:,Results:,Discussion,,Conclusions:,Effects of angular frequency during clinorotation on mesenchymal stem cell morphology and migration,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515506/,

Here we describe the sequential roles of FGF-2 in inducing gene expression, cell growth and BMP-2 in gene expression and mineralization of bone. Materials and methods The regulation of gene expression was determined using real-time RTPCR (qRTPCR) and cell proliferation was measured by thymidine incorporation or fluorescent analysis of DNA content in MC3T3E1 osteoblast-like cells. Photomicroscopy was used to identify newly mineralized tissue and fluorescence was used to quantify mineralization. Results Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) had the greatest ability to induce proliferation after 24 hours of treatment when compared to transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), bone morphogenic protein (BMP-2), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) or prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ). We found that FGF-2 caused the most significant induction of expression of early growth response-1 ( egr-1), fgf-2, cyclo-oxygenase-2 (cox-2), tgfβ and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (mmp-3) associated with proliferation and expression of angiogenic genes like vascular endothelial growth factor A ( vegfA) and its receptor vegfr1 . We found that FGF-2 significantly reduced gene expression associated with mineralization, e.g. collagen type-1 (col1a1), fibronectin (fn), osteocalcin (oc), IGF-1, noggin, bone morphogenic protein (bmp-2) and alkaline phosphatase (alp) . In contrast, BMP-2 significantly stimulated expression of the mineralization associated genes but had little or no effect on gene expression associated with growth. Conclusions The ability of FGF-2 to re-program a mineralizing gene expression profile to one of proliferation suggests that FGF-2 plays a critical role of osteoblast growth in early fracture repair while BMP-2 is instrumental in stimulating mineralization.",Introduction,Materials and methods,Results,Discussion,,Conclusions,"The role of FGF-2 and BMP-2 in regulation of gene induction, cell proliferation and mineralization.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3044105/,

We examined the effects of lycopene and fish oil supplements versus placebo on the normal prostate microenvironment, among men pursuing active surveillance for low-burden prostate cancer. We hypothesized that lycopene or fish oil supplements would down-regulate insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF - 1 ) and cyclooxygenase 2 ( COX - 2 ) gene expression, respectively, reflecting putative proliferation ( IGF - 1 ) and inflammatory ( COX - 2 ) pathways relevant to carcinogenesis. Methods We conducted a 3-month randomized, double-blinded, clinical trial comparing prostate tissue gene expression profiles (assessed by qRT–PCR) among men with favorable-risk prostate cancer receiving either 30 mg/day lycopene, 3 g/day fish oil (including 1,098 mg eicosapentaenoic and 549 mg docosahexaenoic fatty acid s ) or placebo.

Mechanisms regarding abnormal AEC II in BPD remain unclear. The present work investigated the role and mechanisms of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells in lung disorder in BPD using public datasets, clinical samples, a hyperoxia-induced BPD mouse model and AEC II-iNKT cells transwell co-culture system. Firstly, we found that the NKT cells development factor IL-15 increased over time in patients with BPD in public databases, and clinically collected peripheral blood NKT cells in patients with BPD were increased. Subsequently, the percentage of iNKT cells increased in hyperoxia group compared with normoxia group, with the highest at P7, accompanied by increased activation with abnormal lung development. The administration of anti-CD1d neutralizing antibody to inhibit iNKT cells could alleviate the abnormal lung development of hyperoxia group mice, while α-GalCer administration could aggravate lung injury in hyperoxia group mice, and adoptive transfer of iNKT cells could aggravate the abnormal lung development in hyperoxia group mice. In addition, to further verify the role of iNKT cells on AEC II, AEC II-iNKT cells co-culture system was established. The presence of iNKT cells could aggravate the abnormal expression of SP-C and T1α under hyperoxia. Meanwhile, RNA-seq analysis showed that ferroptosis-related genes were highly expressed in AEC II co-cultured with iNKT cells under hyperoxia. We further validated the effect of the presence of iNKT cells under hyperoxia environment on AEC II ferroptosis levels, suggested that iNKT cells promote AEC II ferroptosis under hyperoxia, accompanied by decreased expression of SP-C and T1α.

Global gene expression analyses revealed that genes upregulated in 3D culture were distinct from those upregulated during liver development and liver regeneration. Instead, they represented a diverse array of hepatocyte-specific functional genes with significant over-representation of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α ( Hnf4a ) binding sites in their promoters. Expression of Hnf4a and many of its downstream target genes were significantly increased in RWV cultures as compared to TCD.

We tested the hypothesis that spaceflight causes changes in microRNA (miRNA) expression. Human leukocytes were stimulated with mitogens on board the International Space Station using an onboard normal gravity control. Bioinformatics showed that miR-21 was significantly up-regulated 2-fold during early T-cell activation in normal gravity, and gene expression was suppressed under microgravity. This was confirmed using quantitative real-time PCR ( n = 4). This is the first report that spaceflight regulates miRNA expression. Global microarray analysis showed significant ( P < 0.05) suppression of 85 genes under microgravity conditions compared to normal gravity samples. EGR3 , FASLG, BTG2, SPRY2, and TAGAP are biologically confirmed targets and are co-up-regulated with miR-21. These genes share common promoter regions with pre-mir-21; as the miR-21 matures and accumulates, it most likely will inhibit translation of its target genes and limit the immune response. These data suggest that gravity regulates T-cell activation not only by transcription promotion but also by blocking translation via noncoding RNA mechanisms.

Here, I review more than thirty years of research from my laboratory, beginning with studies designed to test the theory that cells use tensegrity (tensional integrity) architecture to stabilize their shape and sense mechanical signals, which I believed to be critical for control of cell function and tissue development. Although I was trained as a cell biologist, I found that the tools I had at my disposal were insufficient to experimentally test these theories, and thus I ventured into engineering to find critical solutions. This path has been extremely fruitful as it has led to confirmation of the critical role that physical forces play in developmental control, as well as how cells sense and respond to mechanical signals at the molecular level through a process known as cellular mechanotransduction. Many of the predictions of the cellular tensegrity model relating to cell mechanical behaviors have been shown to be valid, and this vision of cell structure led to discovery of the central role that transmembrane adhesion receptors, such as integrins, and the cytoskeleton play in mechanosensing and mechanochemical conversion. In addition, these fundamental studies have led to significant unexpected technology fallout, including development of micromagnetic actuators for non-invasive control of cellular signaling, microfluidic systems as therapeutic extracorporeal devices for sepsis therapy, and new DNA-based nanobiotechnology approaches that permit construction of artificial tensegrities that mimic properties of living materials for applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.",,,,,,,"From cellular mechanotransduction to biologically inspired engineering: 2009 Pritzker Award Lecture, BMES Annual Meeting October 10, 2009.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2913424/,

Additionally, environmental surface samples from eight different habitable locations in the ISS were collected from two flights. Environmental samples from one flight were collected by the crewmember and samples from the next flight were collected after the crewmember departed. The microbial composition in both environment and crewmember samples was measured using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and processed using the Livermore Metagenomics Analysis Toolkit. Ordination of sample to sample distances showed that of the eight crew body sites analyzed, skin, nostril, and ear samples are more similar in microbial composition to the ISS surfaces than mouth and saliva samples; and that the microbial composition of the crewmember’s skin samples are more closely related to the ISS surface samples collected by the crewmember on the same flight than ISS surface samples collected by other crewmembers on different flights. In these collections, species alpha diversity in saliva samples appears to decrease during flight and rebound after returning to Earth. This is the first study to compare the ISS microbiome to a crewmember’s microbiome via shotgun metagenomic sequencing.

The Microbial Tracking 1 (MT-1) project was the first ISS environmental surface study to report on the metagenome profiles without using whole-genome amplification. The study surveyed the microbial communities from eight surfaces over a 14-month period. The Microbial Tracking 2 (MT-2) project aimed to continue the work of MT-1, sampling an additional four flights from the same locations, over another 14 months. Methods Eight surfaces across the ISS were sampled with sterile wipes and processed upon return to Earth. DNA extracted from the processed samples (and controls) were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA) to detect intact/viable cells or left untreated and to detect the total DNA population (free DNA/compromised cells/intact cells/viable cells). DNA extracted from PMA-treated and untreated samples were analyzed using shotgun metagenomics. Samples were cultured for bacteria and fungi to supplement the above results. Results Staphylococcus sp. and Malassezia sp. were the most represented bacterial and fungal species, respectively, on the ISS. Overall, the ISS surface microbiome was dominated by organisms associated with the human skin. Multi-dimensional scaling and differential abundance analysis showed significant temporal changes in the microbial population but no spatial differences. The ISS antimicrobial resistance gene profiles were however more stable over time, with no differences over the 5-year span of the MT-1 and MT-2 studies. Twenty-nine antimicrobial resistance genes were detected across all samples, with macrolide/lincosamide/streptogramin resistance being the most widespread. Metagenomic assembled genomes were reconstructed from the dataset, resulting in 82 MAGs. Functional assessment of the collective MAGs showed a propensity for amino acid utilization over carbohydrate metabolism. Co-occurrence analyses showed strong associations between bacterial and fungal genera. Culture analysis showed the microbial load to be on average 3.0 × 10 5 cfu/m 2 Conclusions Utilizing various metagenomics analyses and culture methods, we provided a comprehensive analysis of the ISS surface microbiome, showing microbial burden, bacterial and fungal species prevalence, changes in the microbiome, and resistome over time and space, as well as the functional capabilities and microbial interactions of this unique built microbiome.

Individuals with high I max / I min values are inferred to have been very active, whereas individuals with low values are inferred to have been more sedentary. However, there is little direct evidence that activity has a causal and predictable effect on the shaft bending strength index. Here, we report the results of two experiments that were designed to test the model within which anthropologists commonly interpret the shaft bending strength index. In the first experiment, mice were treated daily with treadmill exercise for 1 month to simulate a high-activity lifestyle. In the second experiment, in an attempt to simulate a low-activity lifestyle, functional weight-bearing was removed from the hindlimbs of mice for 1 month. Femoral mid-shaft structure was determined with μCT. We found that while exercise resulted in significant enhancement of I max and I min compared with controls, it failed to significantly increase the I max / I min index. Similarly, stunted bone growth caused by unloading resulted in significantly diminished I max and I min compared with controls, but low activity did not lead to significantly decreased I max / I min compared with normal activity.

As importantly, the degree to which any given bone can adapt to functional challenges may be enabled, or constrained, by regional variation in the capacity of marrow progenitors to differentiate into bone-forming cells. Here, we investigate the relationship between bone adaptation and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) responsivity in growing mice subject to exercise. First, using a force plate, we show that peak external forces generated by forelimbs during quadrupedal locomotion are significantly higher than hindlimb forces. Second, by subjecting mice to treadmill running and then measuring bone structure with μCT, we show that skeletal effects of exercise are site-specific but not defined by load magnitudes. Specifically, in the forelimb, where external forces generated by running were highest, exercise failed to augment diaphyseal structure in either the humerus or radius, nor did it affect humeral trabecular structure. In contrast, in the ulna, femur and tibia, exercise led to significant enhancements of diaphyseal bone areas and moments of area. Trabecular structure was also enhanced by running in the femur and tibia. Finally, using flow cytometry, we show that marrow-derived MSCs in the femur are more responsive to exercise-induced loads than humeral cells, such that running significantly lowered MSC populations only in the femur.

Horizontal but not vertical LIV realigned the cell cytoskeleton, culminating in increased cell stiffness. Our results show that applying very small oscillatory motions within the primary cell attachment plane, rather than perpendicular to it, amplifies the cell’s response to LIV, ostensibly facilitating a more effective transfer of intracellular forces.

Osteocyte apoptosis has also been spatially linked to bone resorption owing to disuse, but whether apoptosis plays a similar controlling role is unclear. We, therefore, 1) evaluated the spatial and temporal effects of disuse from hindlimb unloading (HLU) on osteocyte apoptosis, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) expression, bone resorption, and loss in mouse femora, and 2) tested whether osteocyte apoptosis was required to activate osteoclastic activity in cortical and trabecular bone by treating animals subjected to HLU with the pan-caspase apoptosis inhibitor, QVD (quinolyl-valyl-O-methylaspartyl-[-2,6-difluorophenoxy]-methylketone). Immunohistochemistry was used to identify apoptotic and RANKL-producing osteocytes in femoral diaphysis and distal trabecular bone, and μCT was used to determine the extent of trabecular bone loss owing to HLU. In both cortical and trabecular bone, 5 days of HLU increased osteocyte apoptosis significantly (3- and 4-fold, respectively, p < 0.05 versus Ctrl). At day 14, the apoptotic osteocyte number in femoral cortices declined to near control levels but remained elevated in trabeculae (3-fold versus Ctrl, p < 0.05). The number of osteocytes producing RANKL in both bone compartments was also significantly increased at day 5 of HLU (>1.5-fold versus Ctrl, p <0.05) and further increased by day 14. Increases in osteocyte apoptosis and RANKL production preceded increases in bone resorption at both endocortical and trabecular surfaces. QVD completely inhibited not only the HLU-triggered increases in osteocyte apoptosis but also RANKL production and activation of bone resorption at both sites.

Conversely, disuse on Earth or during spaceflight, reduces normal mechanical loading of organisms, resulting in altered cell and tissue function. Although gravity mechanical loading in adult mammals is known to promote increased cell proliferation and differentiation, little is known about how distinct cell types respond to gravity mechanostimulation during early development. In this study we sought to understand, with single cell RNA-sequencing resolution, how a 60-min pulse of 50 g hypergravity (HG)/5 kPa hydrostatic pressure, influences transcriptomic regulation of developmental processes in the embryoid body (EB) model. Our study included both day-9 EBs and progenitor mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with or without the HG pulse. Single cell t-distributed stochastic neighbor mapping shows limited transcriptome shifts in response to the HG pulse in either ESCs or EBs; this pulse however, induces greater positional shifts in EB mapping compared to ESCs, indicating the influence of mechanotransduction is more pronounced in later states of cell commitment within the developmental program. More specifically, HG resulted in upregulation of self-renewal and angiogenesis genes in ESCs, while in EBs, HG loading was associated with upregulation of Gene Ontology-pathways for multicellular development, mechanical signal transduction, and DNA damage repair. Cluster transcriptome analysis of the EBs show HG promotes maintenance of transitory cell phenotypes in early development; including EB cluster co-expression of markers for progenitor, post-implant epiblast, and primitive endoderm phenotypes with HG pulse but expression exclusivity in the non-pulsed clusters. Pseudotime analysis identified three branching cell types susceptible to HG induction of cell fate decisions. In totality, this study provides novel evidence that ESC maintenance and EB development can be regulated by gravity mechanostimulation and that stem cells committed to a differentiation program are more sensitive to gravity-induced changes to their transcriptome.",Introduction,Materials and Methods,Results,Discussion,,Conclusions,Differential Single Cell Responses of Embryonic Stem Cells Versus Embryoid Bodies to Gravity Mechanostimulation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9293686/,

We find that macrophages form dense clusters around spores, establishing a protective niche for fungal survival. Macrophages exert these protective effects by inhibiting fungal germination, thereby inhibiting subsequent neutrophil recruitment and neutrophil-mediated killing. Germination directly drives fungal clearance as faster-growing CEA10-derived strains are killed better in vivo than slower-growing Af293-derived strains. Additionally, a CEA10 pyrG -deficient strain with impaired germination is cleared less effectively by neutrophils. Host inflammatory activation through Myd88 is required for killing of a CEA10-derived strain but not sufficient for killing of an Af293-derived strain, further demonstrating the role of fungal-intrinsic differences in the ability of a host to clear an infection.

For UV-C exposure and secondary metabolite (SM) analysis, approximately 10 2 conidia per plate (diameter, 10 cm) were suspended in 5 ml of GMM agar containing half of the agar concentration (top agar) and grown at 37°C for 7 days. For assessment of virulence in larval zebrafish, plates were inoculated with 1 × 10 6 conidia of the appropriate fungal strain and incubated at 37°C for 3 days. Conidia were harvested in 0.01% (vol/vol) Tween 80 using a cell spreader and filtered through Miracloth. Conidial stocks for microinjection were resuspended in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at a concentration of 1.5 × 10 8 conidia/ml. Construction of mutants. To create the Δ pksP mutant in IF1SW-F4, the CRISPR-Cas9 system developed by the Mortensen lab was used ( 65 ). In brief, the IF1SW-F4 was tested for antibiotic sensitivity against hygromycin (hyg) and phleomycin (ble) to determine the selection marker and associated plasmid for targeting pksP . The strain showed sensitivity to 80 μg/ml hyg; hence, the plasmid pFC332 containing the hyg cassette was used for fungal transformation. Further, the 20-bp sequence 5′-ATC GCC AGC AAC GCC ACG CA-3′, a protospacer targeting pksP , was selected within the pksP gene and introduced to the pFC332 plasmid using the custom primers Fw1 (5′-TAG CTG TTT CCG CTG A-3′), Rev1 (5′-TGC GTG GCG TTG CTG GCG ATG ACG AGC TTA CTC GTT TCG TCC TCA CGG ACT CAT CAG ATC GCC CGG TGA TGT CTG CTC AAG-3′), Fw2 (5′-TCG TCA TCG CCA GCA ACG CCA CGC AGT TTT AGA GCT AGA AAT AGC AAG TTA A-3′), and Rev2 (5′-ATT CTG CTG TCT CGG CTG-3′). Upon this step, plasmid was propagated into Escherichia coli DH5α, purified using the QIAprep Spin miniprep kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and used for transformation. Correct transformants were selected based on the loss of the pigment and used for downstream analyses. For gene deletion mutants, construction of the gene deletion cassette, production of protoplasts, and subsequent polyethylene glycol (PEG) transformation were performed as described previously ( 66 ). Briefly, primers ( Table S3 ) were designed containing a 20- to 30-bp overlap were used to amplify 1,000-bp homologous regions of the gene of interest using SeqBuilder (DNAStar, Madison, WI). 10.1128/mBio.03415-19.7 TABLE S3 Primers used in this study.

These flanks were fused to a selectable marker containing either the A. fumigatus pyrG or Aspergillus parasiticus pyrG gene, amplified from the pKJA12 or pJW24 plasmids, respectively, and the resulting cassette was then transformed into the parent strain via PEG transformation ( 45 ). Strains were transformed using either Af293.1, providing a background with an intact akuA , or TFYL 80.1 for the Δ akuA background. Transformants were screened by selecting transformants that were able to grow in the absence of the appropriate supplements. Loss of the gene of interest and proper integration of the deletion construct were confirmed via PCR and Southern blot analysis ( Fig. S3 ). UV-C exposure and survival evaluation. To evaluate the UV-C sensitivity of studied mutants, approximately 10 2 conidia/plate were exposed to various UV-C doses. Conidia were suspended in top GMM cooled to 55°C, and 5 ml of this suspension was added to plates with 20 ml of GMM (100% of the agar). Triplicates of each strain were exposed to 10-, 15-, and 20-mJ/cm 2 doses of UV-C using a Hoefer UVC 500 crosslinker (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK). Upon exposure, treated and untreated (control plates) were incubated at 37°C. After 7 days, CFU were enumerated, and the percent survival was calculated using the following formula: no. of CFU exposed to any given dose ( N )/CFU in control plate ( N 0 ) × 100. The results from three biological replicates were pooled and used for statistical analysis with GraphPad Prism 8 using Welch’s corrected t test. Secondary metabolite extraction and analysis. To examine the production of SMs of interest, agar plugs in triplicate were collected from unexposed plates. Plugs were extracted with 3 ml of methanol (MeOH) and 1:1 MeOH-DCM each, followed by 1 h of sonication. Crude extracts were evaporated in vacuo and extracted with 3 ml of ethyl acetate (EtOAc). The EtOAc layer was evaporated in vacuo to yield a residue suspended in 1 ml of 20% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-MeOH, and 10 μl was examined by high-performance liquid chromatography–photodiode array detection–mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-MS) analysis. HPLC-MS was carried out using a Thermo Finnigan LCQ Advantage ion trap mass spectrometer with a reverse-phase (RP) C 18 column (Alltech Prevail C 18 , 3 mm, 2.1 by 100 mm) at a flow rate 125 μl/min. The solvent gradient for LC-MS was 95% methyl cyanide (MeCN)-H 2 O (solvent B) in 5% MeCN-H 2 O (solvent A), both containing 0.05% formic acid, as follows: 0% solvent B from 0 to 5 min, 0% to 100% solvent B from 5 min to 35 min, 100% solvent B from 35 to 40 min, 100% to 0% solvent B from 40 to 45 min, and reequilibration with 0% solvent B from 45 to 50 min. Zebrafish care and maintenance. Adult zebrafish were reared as described previously ( 46 ). Briefly, adults were maintained on a dedicated aquatic system and subjected to a light/dark cycle of 14 h/10 h and fed twice a day. After spawning, embryos were collected in E3 buffer supplemented with methylene blue (MB) to inhibit fungal growth and incubated at 28.5°C. At 24 h postfertilization, embryos were manually decoryonated and transferred to E3 buffer lacking MB. Prior to microinjection, larvae were anesthetized in E3 buffer containing 0.2 mg/ml Tricaine (ethyl 3-aminobenzoate; Sigma-Aldrich). Larval zebrafish procedures and adult handling were performed in compliance with NIH guidelines and approved by the University of Wisconsin—Madison Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Larval zebrafish virulence assay. Virulence assays were performed using the larval zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis, as described previously ( 46 ), with slight modifications. Neutrophil-defective larvae were obtained genetically through the use of transgenic mpx:mCherry-2A-rac2D57N larvae ( 47 ). Prior to infection, larvae were screened and selected for mCherry expression in neutrophils to identify individuals harboring the dominant negative allele. Briefly, hindbrain ventricle infections were performed at 48 h postfertilization using conidial stocks that were mixed 2:1 with 1% phenol red (used to visualize injection success) to a final concentration of 1 × 10 8 conidia/ml stock. Larvae were anesthetized in E3 lacking MB and supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml Tricaine prior to microinjection of 3 nl conidia stock or PBS vehicle control into the hindbrain ventricle through the otic vesicle. Following microinjection, larvae were rinsed several times to remove the anesthetic and transferred to individual wells of a 96-well plate in ∼200 μl E3 lacking MB. The survival of individual larvae was scored daily using a loss of heartbeat as a readout of mortality. Survival analysis for larval zebrafish infection experiments was performed as previously described ( 46 ) by pooling experimental replicates and generating P values by the Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.",,Contributions of spore secondary metabolites to UV-C protection and virulence vary in different Aspergillus fumigatus strains,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7029147/,

The availability of water and light, as well as the presence of a constant gravity vector, are all environmental stimuli that plants sense and respond to via directed growth movements (tropisms). The plant response to gravity (gravitropism) and the response to unidirectional light (phototropism) have long been shown to be interconnected growth phenomena. Here, we discuss the similarities in these two processes, as well as the known molecular mechanisms behind the tropistic responses. We also highlight research done in a microgravity environment in order to decouple two tropisms through experiments carried out in the absence of a significant unilateral gravity vector. In addition, alteration of gravity, especially the microgravity environment, and light irradiation produce important effects on meristematic cells, the undifferentiated, highly proliferating, totipotent cells which sustain plant development. Microgravity produces the disruption of meristematic competence, i.e., the decoupling of cell proliferation and cell growth, affecting the regulation of the cell cycle and ribosome biogenesis. Light irradiation, especially red light, mediated by phytochromes, has an activating effect on these processes. Phytohormones, particularly auxin, also are key mediators in these alterations.

The use of plants as part of life support systems will require a better understanding of the interactions among plant growth responses including tropisms, under partial gravity conditions. Materials and Methods: Here, we present results from our latest space experiments on the ISS, in which seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana were germinated, and seedlings grew for six days under different gravity levels, namely micro- g , several intermediate partial- g levels, and 1 g , and were subjected to irradiation with blue light for the last 48 h. RNA was extracted from 20 samples for subsequent RNAseq analysis. Transcriptomic analysis was performed using the HISAT2-Stringtie-DESeq pipeline. Differentially expressed genes were further characterized for global responses using the GEDI tool, gene networks and for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment. Results: Differential gene expression analysis revealed only one differentially expressed gene (AT4G21560, VPS28-1 a vacuolar protein) across all gravity conditions using FDR correction (q < 0.05). However, the same 14 genes appeared differentially expressed when comparing either micro- g , low- g level (< 0.1 g ) or the Moon g -level with 1 g control conditions. Apart from these 14-shared genes, the number of differentially expressed genes was similar in microgravity and the Moon g -level and increased in the intermediate g -level (< 0.1 g ), but it was then progressively reduced as the difference with the Earth gravity became smaller. The GO groups were differentially affected at each g -level: light and photosynthesis GO under microgravity, genes belonged to general stress, chemical and hormone responses under low- g , and a response related to cell wall and membrane structure and function under the Moon g -level. Discussion: Transcriptional analyses of plants under blue light stimulation suggests that root blue-light phototropism may be enough to reduce the gravitational stress response caused by the lack of gravitropism in microgravity. Competition among tropisms induces an intense perturbation at the micro- g level, which shows an extensive stress response that is progressively attenuated. Our results show a major effect on cell wall/membrane remodeling (detected at the interval from the Moon to Mars gravity), which can be potentially related to graviresistance mechanisms.",Introduction,Materials and Methods,Results,Discussion,"Discussion Blue Light Phototropism May Be Enough to Reduce the Gravitational Stress Response on Orbit Image analysis of seedlings grown during the Seedling Growth suite of experiments previously characterized a novel blue-light phototropic response in roots of A. thaliana grown in conditions of microgravity ( Vandenbrink et al., 2016 ). This relationship was shown to be linearly related to the magnitude of the gravity vector for plants exposed to red light, but plants exposed to blue light showed rapid attenuation of the response in the presence of increasing gravity levels. To determine the differential response to reduced gravity and attempt to dissect the molecular mechanisms of gravisensing, we performed RNA-seq analysis to characterize changes in gene expression that may be associated with the novel blue phototropic response. Interestingly, the effect of blue-light illumination is clearly observable in the microgravity samples, with a clear enrichment in GO terms related with light perception, photosynthesis and biosynthesis of the photosynthetic complexes as previously reported ( Vandenbrink et al., 2019 ), but it is barely appearing in the GO enrichment analyses that we performed on partial gravity samples, even bellow 0.1 g (low g conditions). Surprisingly, the phototropic response to the blue light seems to be enough to cancel the effects of other genes of interest in gravitational research (as the ones observed at low g or Moon g level) to be not significantly affected in microgravity conditions. This result may be complementing previous reports from the same Seedling Growth spaceflight experiment but with plants exposed to red photostimulation. Fundamental plant functions, as cell proliferation and cell growth activity in root meristems, known to be affected by microgravity in the absence of light ( Matía et al., 2010 ) are balanced just by providing a red photostimulation phase ( Valbuena et al., 2018 ). In both red and blue photostimulation samples within the Seedling Growth experiment, roots are exhibiting a positive phototropism that can compensate the gravitropism stimuli role that it is required to preserve meristematic competence in orbit, as shown by the longer root growth in microgravity and 1 g samples in comparison with 0.1 g seedlings ( Vandenbrink et al., 2016 ). Low- g Effect: Competition Between Tropisms or Artifacts of Reduced-Gravity Simulation? The large number of DEGs detected in the low- g conditions (<0.1 g ) is a striking result of this study. The type of transcriptional response observed in this group is similar to stress-related responses reported in other spaceflight or simulated microgravity datasets ( Paul et al., 2012 ; Correll et al., 2013 ; Sugimoto et al., 2014 ; Ferl et al., 2015 ; Kwon et al., 2015 ; Johnson et al., 2017 ; Paul et al., 2017 ; Shi et al., 2017 ; Zupanska et al., 2017 ; Choi et al., 2019 ). In this case, there is a very clear component of “Response to General Stress” with a FDR q value <10 −10 , without any other GO terms to be similarly affected. In contrast the responses at the microgravity level (FDR q value <10 −6 ), or at the Moon g -level (FDR q value <10 −2 ) are very subtle. We explain these results as being the consequence of the combination of two tropistic responses acting with very low intensity. It is very likely that the subtle blue phototropism and the weak gravitropism signal at approximately 0.09 g are competing to take the leading role in providing the fundamental cue for driving seedling growth and plant development. The result is a stress for the plant (blue-LEDS are located laterally while the gravity vector is towards the bottom of the cassette), which needs to adapt its developmental plan to an environment without the usual tropistic cues. The transcriptional adaptation to provide a response to this evolutionary novel and challenging environment requires the modification of more than five hundred genes, while microgravity only requires half of this number. An alternative explanation to the low- g effects that cannot be completely excluded could be put in connection with simulated microgravity experiments. Secondary effects of microgravity simulation facilities (shear or inertial forces) and even small variations in the environmental conditions of experimental and control samples may lead to gene expression variations in a similar set of genes as those observed in the low- g subgroup in this work. Similarly, it is important to take into account the existence of hardware effects when growing plants in real microgravity ( Kiss, 2015 ), including lack of convection, reduced CO 2 levels, improper temperature, elevated ethylene, spacecraft vibrations, increased radiation exposure, among others. However, the tropism conflict interpretation introduced early on this section seems to have a greater contribution than the artifacts of centrifugation in the low- g effects. A hardware side-effect explanation is less conceivable since the present study was conducted utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System, which contains an air scrubbing/filtration system designed for removing excess ethylene from the seedlings during the growth phase ( Kiss et al., 2014 ; Kiss, 2015 ). Thus, even with proper ventilation, a reduction in gene expression of photosynthetic genes was observed in the microgravity samples ( Vandenbrink et al., 2019 ). In the case of the samples exposed to centrifugation, the ventilation effect should be less important, but the centrifugation by itself could lead to additional stress in the samples. However, this centrifugation factor is also present in the 1 g control sample, exposed to even higher angular speeds. Spaceflight experimentation is required to verify that simulation strategies on Earth analogues are reliable and worthy. The continuous validation of the best simulation strategies will optimize and increase our chances of success in future spaceflight experiments ( Herranz et al., 2013 ). Additional research in simulated low- g conditions on Earth or even in the Moon surface will help to extend and validate this research work. Moon and Mars- g Effects and the Consequences for Manned Spaceflight Missions Cultivating plants as part of life support systems in nearby objects of our planet will require us to expose the plants to the partial- g interval within the two values we examined here, namely, Moon g -level (0.18 ± 0.04 g ) and Mars gravity (0.36 ± 0.02 g ). Although some of the genes and GO terms observed affected at lower g -levels also appeared in these conditions, the existence of the gravitropic response, in combination with blue light illumination, seems to be enough to restore a nearly normal transcriptional state, particularly at the Mars g -level. These results are consistent with previous data coming from partial gravity simulation paradigms that validated that Arabidopsis developmental plan is still affected at the Moon g -level (even more intensely affected than in similar simulated microgravity samples) but that the “normal” developmental plan is almost completely restored at Mars g -levels ( Kamal et al., 2018 ; Manzano et al., 2018 ). The identity of some of the GO terms significantly affected at the Moon g -level suggest some structural stress at the level of the cell wall and membrane systems. This result is consistent with other results in spaceflight experiments ( Kwon et al., 2015 ; Johnson et al., 2017 ; Zupanska et al., 2017 ). This effect is progressively weaker from Moon- g (almost similar to microgravity) to Mars- g , which shows a less intense response, but it is still visible at g -levels as high as 0.57 g , when utilizing the less stringent analysis ( Figure 2A ). At these g -levels, gravitropism response may be acting and suppressing the recently described blue-light root phototropism, (already at the Moon g -level, see Figure 1C ). Therefore, we suggest that this transcriptional response could be related with the graviresistance signal that the cells without professional gravisensing organelles (as the statolith in the columella cells of the root) may use to detect g -force ( Soga, 2013 ). Particularly at the Moon g -level, the very weak gravitropic signal may be still in conflict with a graviresistance tension in the cell wall and membrane systems (also weak), inducing and additional stress that is progressively removed when Mars g -level is reached. In that regard, we have found that some of the genes changing throughout the series of reduced gravity levels can be connected in a pathway in which certain genes may have a central position ( Figure 4 ). The most connected nodes in the pathway would be the genes involved in the cross-talk between the cell-membrane-localized (AT3G44430 and AT2G34840) and the F-box/RMI-like/FDB-like domain proteins (AT5G56370 and AT5G56380) candidate genes. An important caveat to our results is that RNA was obtained from whole seedlings, despite our assumption that the root is the organ that can discriminate better the weak phototropism and gravitropism signals that are proposed here to be responsible of the transcriptional variations we have shown here.","Conclusions The results of this study take advantage of the induction of subtle blue-light phototropism in roots in spaceflight to discern the transcriptional responses to different tropisms in orbit. Removal of the influence of gravity on blue-light-illuminated seedlings showed a reduction in gene expression in multiple pathways associated with photosynthesis, suggesting shared molecular pathways between the two tropistic responses, or a functional compensation among them. It is important to emphasize that the effects shown at microgravity here are gradually removed by increasing g -load. While the phototropic effect is noted at the microgravity level, a general stress response is detected at <0.1 g , probably due to conflicting stimuli, just at the detection threshold of photo- and gravi-sensing mechanisms. Membrane-related gene ontologies became the more significant at the Moon g -level, and they become progressively weaker at higher g -levels, allowing us to discriminate the differential contribution of the classical statolith-based gravitropism from other responses based on cell tensegrity that may require a higher g -threshold to be fully active ( Hoson et al., 2005 ; Hoson and Wakabayashi, 2015 ). Therefore, our results are starting to isolate, at the whole transcriptional level, the global effects that are produced by the gravitropism, phototropism and graviresistance mechanisms, working at different g -level thresholds. Future use of mutant lines will help us to confirm and extend these findings, which suggests an intricate connection between gravity and light perception in A. thaliana . In the long term, these results on the interaction among tropisms will be important for the use of plants in bioregenerative support systems needed for the human exploration of the Solar System.",RNAseq analysis of the response of Arabidopsis thaliana to fractional gravity under blue-light stimulation during spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6889863/,

This force has played an important role in shaping development and morphology from the molecular level to the whole organism. Although aquatic life experiences reduced gravity effects, land plants have evolved under a 1- g environment. Understanding gravitational effects requires changing the magnitude of this force. One method of eliminating gravity'’s influence is to enter into a free-fall orbit around the planet, thereby achieving a balance between centripetal force of gravity and the centrifugal force of the moving object. This balance is often mistakenly referred to as microgravity, but is best described as weightlessness. In addition to actually compensating gravity, instruments such as clinostats, random-positioning machines (RPM), and magnetic levitation devices have been used to eliminate effects of constant gravity on plant growth and development. However, these platforms do not reduce gravity but constantly change its direction. Despite these fundamental differences, there are few studies that have investigated the comparability between these platforms and weightlessness. Here, we provide a review of the strengths and weaknesses of these analogs for the study of plant growth and development compared to spaceflight experiments. We also consider reduced or partial gravity effects via spaceflight and analog methods. While these analogs are useful, the fidelity of the results relative to spaceflight depends on biological parameters and environmental conditions that cannot be simulated in ground-based studies.",Introduction,,,,"Centrifuges Although it sounds somewhat counterintuitive, we can also explore the effects of microgravity by the application of centrifuges. This reduced gravity paradigm (RGP) is based on the premise that adaptations seen going from a hypergravity level to a lower gravity level are similar to changes seen going from 1 g to microgravity ( van Loon, 2016 ). Using such a paradigm, we are not focusing on the absolute acceleration values but rather on the responses generated due to the change between the two accelerations levels. The premise of such an experiment is that the plant sample has to be adapted and stable to a higher gravity level such as 2 g . Then, as the g -level is lowered to 1 g , the plant will respond to this reduced gravity level. It is hypothesized that the processes in such adaptations are of the same type as one would see going from 1 g into free fall, although the magnitude might be different. Thus, this reduced gravity paradigm is best used for stable and steady systems at a certain higher g level combined with measuring a relatively fast responding phenomenon when reducing the acceleration load.","Reduced or Partial Gravity Studies Numerous studies on plant growth and development have been performed in space ( Wolverton and Kiss, 2009 ; Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2016 ). In contrast, we know little about plant physiology in reduced gravity environments, which are less than the normal 1 g that characterizes Earth-based studies. Reduced gravity can also be termed partial- g or fractional- g . The exploration of the Moon and Mars will be important in the future and will rely upon optimized plant cultivation because plants will be essential for life support systems ( Kiss, 2014 ). Therefore, it is important to develop new knowledge about the biology of plants at the lunar and Martian g -levels, 0.17 g and 0.38 g , respectively. Studies on plants in partial gravity environments also can provide new information on basic biological questions such as what is the threshold of gravisensing in plants (e.g., Kiss et al., 1989 ; Perbal, 2009 ; Duemmer et al., 2015 ). To establish partial gravity on-board sounding rockets or orbiting laboratories, a centrifuge is needed to produce the desired accelerations. Centrifuges can be used to generate any acceleration from near zero to 1 g . Especially 1- g experiments are valuable as in-flight controls, which provide context for the analyses of spaceflight experiments ( Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2016 ). Fortunately, there are several facilities on the International Space Station (ISS) that are equipped with centrifuges, and the ISS can be used to study partial gravity effects on plant development. Plant Responses in Reduced or Partial Gravity in Spaceflight A series of experiments have recently been performed on the ISS with Arabidopsis thaliana and have focused on 1) the interaction between gravitropism and phototropism in microgravity and fractional gravity ( Kiss et al., 2012 ; Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2016 ; Vandenbrink et al., 2016 ) and 2) identification of the threshold for gravity perception in roots in the wild-type and starchless ( pgm-1 ) mutants (Wolverton, in progress). These experiments utilized the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) which had onboard centrifuges allowing for gravitational ranges from microgravity to small fractions of a g up to 1 g ( Kiss et al., 2014 ). The EMCS was decommissioned in 2017, but international space agencies have developed hardware such as Cell Biology Experiment Facility (CBEF) and Biolab support research at fractional g ( Brinckmann, 2012 ). In experiments in which directional light and fractional gravity were applied simultaneously, Kiss and colleagues reported strong positive phototropism in response to unilateral red light in the stem-like hypocotyls and roots of plants grown in microgravity ( Millar et al., 2010 ). In time course studies, shoots had positive phototropism in response to red light in microgravity and at 0.1 g , and the curvature was not significantly different between two gravity conditions ( Figure 6A ). However, the red-light-based phototropism at 0.3 g was not significantly different from the red-light phototropic response of the 1- g control, and there was significant reduction of red-light phototropism at 0.3 g and 1 g (see also Kiss et al., 2012 ). Figure 6 Time course studies of positive phototropic curvature in seedlings of Arabidopsis at indicated gravity levels in a spaceflight experiment. Different letters indicate significant differences among the plots. (A) Response of the shoot-like hypocotyls of Arabidopsis seedlings to red light. The response at 0.3 g was not significantly different from the value of the 1- g control, and there was attenuation of red-light phototropism at 0.3 g and 1 g . (B) Response of the roots of Arabidopsis seedlings to red light. The responses at 0.1 g and 0.3 g were not significantly different from the value of the 1- g control, and these values were attenuated compared to the robust response in microgravity. Figure is adapted from Kiss et al. (2012) . In experiments with seedlings, roots exhibited a strong positive phototropism in response to unidirectional red illumination in microgravity conditions ( Figure 6B ). In contrast to the experiments with shoots, the red-light-based phototropic response in roots at 0.1 g was reduced and not significantly different from the red phototropic curvature at 0.3 g and 1 g . Thus, our fractional gravity experiments demonstrated a reduction of red-light-based phototropic curvature in the shoot-like hypocotyls at the level of 0.3 g , but the level of 0.1 g was enough to reduce the red-light-based phototropism in roots. This range of fractional gravity is approximately the same as the g -levels found on the Moon and Mars, 0.17 g and 0.38 g , respectively. Taken together, our results suggest that this range of reduced g represents a significant sensory threshold. This hypothesis is being investigated further in a separate series of experiments designed to test the threshold force required to activate gravity sensing and response of Arabidopsis seedlings in the EMCS. Ground-based clinostat experiments have estimated the gravity perception threshold at or around 0.003 g ( Shen-Miller et al., 1968 ; Laurinavicius et al., 1998 ; Duemmer et al., 2015 ). This threshold was tested in these space experiments, and the analysis currently is in progress. Extending these results to include the starchless mutant in addition to wild-type seedlings will allow for the comparison of gravity perception threshold in roots that lack sedimenting statoliths ( Kiss et al., 1989 ), which we predict will require greater accelerations to activate perception and response in these seedlings. Plant Responses to Simulated Partial or Reduced Gravity Using Analogs While the main focus of this paper has been on the simulation of microgravity, we also see that there is potential to use the analog devices to simulate partial or reduced gravity conditions that are found on the Moon and Mars ( Kiss, 2014 ). This approach has been recently used in RPM studies of the effects of simulated partial gravity on the balance between cell growth and cell proliferation during early plant development ( Manzano et al., 2018 ). In another recent study using Arabidopsis tissue culture cells, cell proliferation and growth were uncoupled under simulated reduced gravity also using an RPM ( Kamal et al., 2018 ). The results of these few studies are promising and encourage future exploration of simulated partial gravity for other biological systems. Successful application of partial gravity simulation could develop into new avenue of research. For example, the simulated Mars gravity of 0.38 g could be used in various biological studies to help prepare for a human mission to Mars.",Comparison of Microgravity Analogs to Spaceflight in Studies of Plant Growth and Development,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6908503/,

This study examines the impact of altered gravity conditions on the growth and morphological responses of Wolffia globosa (commonly known as “ water lentils ” or “ duckweed ”), assessing its potential as a space crop. Although an experiment testing the effect of simulated microgravity on Wolffia globosa has been previously conducted, for the first time, we investigated the effect of multiple gravity levels on the growth and morphological traits of Wolffia globosa plants. The plant responses to simulated microgravity, simulated partial gravity (Moon), and hypergravity environments were evaluated using random positioning machines and the large-diameter centrifuge. As hypothesized, we observed a slight reaction to different gravitational levels in the growth and morphological traits of Wolffia globosa. The relative growth rates (RGR) of plants subjected to simulated microgravity and partial gravity were reduced when compared to those in other gravity levels. The morphological analysis revealed differences in plant dimensions and frond length-to-width ratios under diverse gravity conditions. Our findings showed that Wolffia globosa is responsive to gravitational changes, with its growth and morphological adaptations being slightly influenced by varying gravitational environments. As for other crop species, growth was reduced by the microgravity conditions; however, RGR remained substantial at 0.33 a day. In conclusion, this study underscores the potential of Wolffia globosa as a space crop and its adaptability to diverse gravitational conditions, contributing to the development of sustainable food production and bioregenerative life support systems for future space exploration missions.",Introduction,Materials and methods,Results,Discussion,,,Conducting plant experiments in space and on the Moon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10764921/,

Deleterious effects of the space environment on plant development have been reported, such as the unbalance of cell growth and proliferation in the root meristem, or gene expression reprogramming. However, plants are capable of surviving and completing the seed-to-seed life cycle under microgravity. A key research challenge is to identify environmental cues, such as light, which could compensate the negative effects of microgravity. Understanding the crosstalk between light and gravity sensing in space was the major objective of the NASA-ESA Seedling Growth series of spaceflight experiments (2013–2018). Different g -levels were used, with special attention to micro- g , Mars- g , and Earth- g . In spaceflight seedlings illuminated for 4 days with a white light photoperiod and then photostimulated with red light for 2 days, transcriptomic studies showed, first, that red light partially reverted the gene reprogramming induced by microgravity, and that the combination of microgravity and photoactivation was not recognized by seedlings as stressful. Two mutant lines of the nucleolar protein nucleolin exhibited differential requirements in response to red light photoactivation. This observation opens the way to directed-mutagenesis strategies in crop design to be used in space colonization. Further transcriptomic studies at different g -levels showed elevated plastid and mitochondrial genome expression in microgravity, associated with disturbed nucleus–organelle communication, and the upregulation of genes encoding auxin and cytokinin hormonal pathways. At the Mars g -level, genes of hormone pathways related to stress response were activated, together with some transcription factors specifically related to acclimation, suggesting that seedlings grown in partial- g are able to acclimate by modulating genome expression in routes related to space-environment-associated stress.",1.

An emerging signaling event in response to unloading is the translocation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOSμ) from the sarcolemma to the cytosol. We used EUK-134, a cell-permeable mimetic of superoxide dismutase and catalase, to test the role of redox signaling in nNOSμ translocation and muscle fiber atrophy as a result of short-term (54 h) hindlimb unloading. Fischer-344 rats were divided into ambulatory control, hindlimb-unloaded (HU), and hindlimb-unloaded + EUK-134 (HU-EUK) groups. EUK-134 mitigated the unloading-induced phenotype, including muscle fiber atrophy and muscle fiber-type shift from slow to fast. nNOSμ immunolocalization at the sarcolemma of the soleus was reduced with HU, while nNOSμ protein content in the cytosol increased with unloading. Translocation of nNOS from the sarcolemma to cytosol was virtually abolished by EUK-134. EUK-134 also mitigated dephosphorylation at Thr-32 of FoxO3a during HU. Hindlimb unloading elevated oxidative stress (4-hydroxynonenal) and increased sarcolemmal localization of Nox2 subunits gp91phox (Nox2) and p47phox, effects normalized by EUK-134. Thus, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that oxidative stress triggers nNOSμ translocation from the sarcolemma and FoxO3a dephosphorylation as an early event during mechanical unloading.

Recent evidence suggests that insufficient heat shock proteins (HSPs) may contribute to apoptosis and muscle wasting. In addition, long-term caloric restriction (CR) and lifelong wheel running exercise (WR) with CR provide significant protection against caspase-dependent apoptosis and sarcopenia. Caspase-independent mediators (endonuclease G: EndoG; apoptosis-inducing factor: AIF) of apoptosis are also linked to muscles wasting with disuse and aging. However, the efficacy of CR and WR with CR to attenuate caspase-independent apoptosis and preserve HSPs in aging skeletal muscle are unknown.

For microbes that accompany humans into space, microgravity-induced alterations in the fluid environment are likely to be a major factor in the microbial experience of spaceflight. Computational modeling is needed to investigate how well ground-based microgravity simulation methods replicate that experience. CAMDLES incorporates agent-based modeling to study inter-species metabolite transport within microbial communities in rotating wall vessel bioreactors (RWVs). Preexisting CFD modeling of RWVs has not yet incorporated growth; CAMDLES employs the simultaneous modeling of biological, chemical, and mechanical processes in a micro-scale rotating reference frame environment. Simulation mass transfer calculations were correlated with Monod dynamic parameters to predict relative growth rates between artificial microgravity, spaceflight microgravity, and 1 g conditions. By simulating a microbial model community of metabolically cooperative strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, we found that the greatest difference between microgravity and an RWV or 1 g gravity was when species colocalized in dense aggregates. We also investigated the influence of other features of the system on growth, such as spatial distribution, product yields, and diffusivity. Our simulation provides a basis for future laboratory experiments using this community for investigation in artificial microgravity and spaceflight microgravity. More broadly, our development of these models creates a framework for novel hypothesis generation and design of biological experiments with RWVs, coupling the effects of RWV size, rotation rate, and mass transport directly to bacterial growth in microbial communities.",1.

APH is a fully enclosed, closed-loop plant life support system with an environmentally controlled growth chamber designed for conducting both fundamental and applied plant research during experiments extending as long as 135 days. APH was delivered to the ISS in parts aboard two commercial resupply missions: OA-7 in April 2017 and SpaceX-11 in June 2017, and was assembled and installed in the Japanese Experiment Module Kibo in November 2018. We report here on a 7-week-long hardware validation test that utilized a root module planted with both Arabidopsis (cv. Col 0) and wheat (cv. Apogee) plants. The validation test examined the APH’s ability to control light intensity, spectral quality, humidity, CO 2 concentration, photoperiod, temperature, and root zone moisture using commanding from ground facilities at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The test also demonstrated the execution of programmed experiment profiles that scheduled: (1) changes in environmental combinations (e.g., a daily photoperiod at constant relative humidity), (2) predetermined photographic events using the three APH cameras [overhead, sideview, and sideview near-infrared (NIR)], and (3) execution of experimental sequences during the life cycle of a crop (e.g., measure photosynthetic CO 2 drawdown experiments). Arabidopsis and wheat were grown in microgravity to demonstrate crew procedures, planting protocols and watering schemes within APH. The ability of APH to contain plant debris was assessed during the harvest of mature Arabidopsis plants. Wheat provided a large evaporative load that tested root zone moisture control and the recovery of transpired water by condensation. The wheat canopy was also used to validate the ability of APH to measure gas exchange of plants from non-invasive gas exchange measurements (i.e., canopy photosynthesis and respiration). These features were evaluated by executing experiment profiles that utilized the CO 2 drawdown technique to measure daily rates of canopy photosynthesis and dark-period CO 2 increase for respiration. This hardware validation test confirmed that APH can measure fundamental plant responses to spaceflight conditions.",Introduction,,,,,Conclusion,Hardware validation of the Advanced Plant Habitat on ISS: Canopy photosynthesis in reduced gravity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314936/,

Significance: New insights into monolignol radical-radical coupling in planta .",Introduction,"EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cloning, Expression, and Purification of PsDRR206 The PsDRR206 gene (GenBank TM accession number U11716 ) was isolated from pea ( P. sativum cv. Alcan) genomic DNA using PCR amplification with gene specific primers (DRR206 forward, ATGGGTTCCAAACTTCTAGTACTA, and DRR206 reverse, TTACCAACACTCAAAGAACTTGAT). Vector construction and transformation were carried out using biolistic bombardment technology as described by Seneviratne et al. ( 7 ), as was expression and purification of the (+)-pinoresinol-forming PsDRR206 recombinant DP in tomato cell culture. Crystallization and X-ray Data Collection Initial crystallization conditions for the PsDRR206 protein were obtained using the microbatch under oil method employing 1536-well microassay plate high throughput screening ( 15 ) at the Hauptman Woodward Institute (Buffalo, NY). Four conditions from preliminary screening produced microcrystals: condition 265, 0.1 m (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 0.1 m CAPS pH 10, PEG8000 20% (v/v); condition 1006, 0.1 m NH 4 Br, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8, PEG 400 40% (v/v); condition 1077, 5% 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (w/v), 0.09 m Bis-Tris propane, pH 7.8, and 27% PEG 3350; and condition 1474, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 m NaOAc, pH 5.0, PEG 400 80% (w/v). Initial “hits” were scaled up in-house as hanging drop vapor diffusion methods on VDX 24-well plates (Hampton Research, CA) incubated at 22 °C with a drop size of 3 μl consisting of equal volumes of protein at a concentration of 4–5 mg/ml in 40 m m MES, pH 5, 20 m m Na 2 SO 4 , 20% glycerol, and reservoir solution. Each drop was equilibrated against a 500-μl reservoir and monitored periodically. Crystallization conditions were further optimized using grid screening. Diffraction quality crystals were obtained from the final optimized crystallization condition 1077, comprising 4% 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (w/v), 0.1 m Bis-Tris propane, pH 7.8, and 35% PEG 3350. Crystals appeared within 5–10 days and grew to the size of 170 × 170 × 150 μm within 10 weeks. The PsDRR206 crystals were subsequently flash cooled in a cryoprotectant crystallization buffer, stored in cryovials, and shipped to the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource for data collection. Native PsDRR206 crystals, diffracting to ∼1.95 Å resolution, belong to the rhombohedral space group H32 (see Table 1 ). A complete data set comprising 600 images with a rotation angle of 0.2° was collected from a single PsDRR206 crystal on Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource Beamline BL12-2 using x-rays at 12,658 eV (0.98093 Å) and a PILATUS 6 m PAD detector running in the shutterless mode. The data were processed with XDS ( 16 ) and scaled with SCALA from the CCP4 suite of programs ( 17 ). The Matthews coefficient ( 18 ) assuming two molecules in the asymmetric unit was 2.0 Å 3 /Da (39% solvent content). The final data collection statistics are given in Table 1 ( 19 ). Data Processing, Structure Determination, and Refinement PsDRR206 structure was solved by molecular replacement using the homology model generated for the (−)-pinoresinol-forming DP AtDIR6 from A. thaliana (PM0078038 ( 11 )), which was derived from an x-ray structure of A. thaliana AOC2 (AtAOC2; PDB code 2BRJ ( 12 )). The sequences of PsDRR206 and AtDIR6 were aligned and the AtDIR6 model was converted into a pseudo-DRR206 model using the program CHAINSAW ( 20 ) from the CCP4 suite ( 17 ). Identical residues in the two sequences were retained, and those that differed were truncated at the Cβ atom. A weak molecular replacement solution, with a weighted R factor of 0.61, and a score of 0.42 was obtained with the program MOLREP ( 21 ). This solution was refined for 15 cycles using REFMAC ( 22 ) giving crystallographic R factor and R free values of 0.48 and 0.54, respectively, and 2 F o − F c and F o − F c electron density maps were calculated. Inspection of the electron density showed that the molecular replacement solution was correct, with side chains truncated by CHAINSAW clearly visible in the 2 F o − F c and F o − F c maps. Refinement of PsDRR206 structure was completed with the PHENIX suite of programs ( 23 ) and manual building of the model using the molecular graphics program COOT ( 24 ). Water molecules were added at structurally and chemically relevant positions, and the atomic displacement parameters for all atoms in the structure were refined isotropically. The final refinement statistics are given in Table 1 . Atomic coordinates and structure factors for PsDRR206 were deposited to the Protein Data Bank ( 25 ) with PDB code 4REV . Superpositions were performed using the SSM procedure ( 26 ) as implemented in COOT ( 24 ) and the program LSQKAB in the CCP4 suite ( 17 ). The figures were generated using PyMOL ( 27 ). The surface topography was analyzed with CASTp ( 28 ) using a probe radius of 1.4 Å. Conserved residues were mapped onto the structure using ConSurf ( 29 ). Computational Docking Experiments PsDRR206 and two ligands were prepared in AutoDockTools4 ( 30 ) with default bonded and nonbonded parameters. One ligand approximated the coniferyl alcohol quinone methide radical (CA • ), with C7 and C8 set to be trivalent, trigonal planar carbon atoms coplanar with the ring carbon and quinone oxygen atoms. A second ligand was the 8–8′ linked bis -quinone methide. Both syn and anti isomers, referring to the relationship between C8 and the methoxyl group, were used in the docking experiments, and rotation about the C7-C8 bond was not allowed in CA • , reflecting its partial double bond character in the resonance hybrid. Flexibility was allowed for the side chains of residues Asp 40 , Phe 79 , Tyr 101 , Ser 111 , Leu 113 , Ile 161 , Thr 163 , and Leu 174 . The grid box was centered upon the ligand with sufficient size to cover the ligand, and all flexible residues and a grid spacing of 0.375 Å.

Here, we investigated whether low dose charged particle irradiation could elicit oxidative stress in neural stem and precursor cells and whether radiation-induced changes in redox metabolism would coincide with cognitive impairment. Results: Low doses (<1 Gy) of charged particles caused an acute and persistent oxidative stress. Early after (<1 week) irradiation, increased levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species were generally dose responsive, but were less dependent on dose weeks to months thereafter. Exposure to ion fluences resulting in less than one ion traversal per cell was sufficient to elicit radiation-induced oxidative stress. Whole body irradiation triggered a compensatory response in the rodent brain that led to a significant increase in antioxidant capacity 2 weeks following exposure, before returning to background levels at week 4. Low dose irradiation was also found to significantly impair novel object recognition in mice 2 and 12 weeks following irradiation. Innovation: Data provide evidence that acute exposure of neural stem cells and the CNS to very low doses and fluences of charged particles can elicit a persisting oxidative stress lasting weeks to months that is associated with impaired cognition. Conclusions: Exposure to low doses of charged particles causes a persistent oxidative stress and cognitive impairment over protracted times.

The emergence of stem cell-derived beta-like cells represents a paradigm shift, with initial clinical trials showing promising insulin secretion in vivo . However, translating these breakthroughs into scalable, widely accessible treatments poses significant challenges. Drawing parallels to space exploration, this paper argues that while scientific feasibility has been demonstrated, true accessibility remains elusive.

It is currently unknown how the OB is altered by spaceflight. In this study, we evaluated OB volume and neurogenesis in mice shortly after a 13-day flight on Space Shuttle Atlantis [Space Transport System (STS)-135] relative to two groups of control mice maintained on Earth. Mice housed on Earth in animal enclosure modules that mimicked the conditions onboard STS-135 (AEM-Ground mice) had greater OB volume relative to mice maintained in standard housing on Earth (Vivarium mice), particularly in the granule (GCL) and glomerular (GL) cell layers. AEM-Ground mice also had more OB neuroblasts and fewer apoptotic cells relative to Vivarium mice.

Repeated intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed before the flight launch and re-measured before the mice were euthanized after splashdown. IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight (14.4–19.3 mmHg vs 16.3–20.3 mmHg) (p < 0.05) for the left eye.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of whole-body high-energy proton exposure at a single dose on apoptosis, oxidative stress, and blood-retina barrier (BRB) integrity in the retina and optic nerve head (ONH) region and to compare these radiation-induced effects with those produced by fractionated dose. Six-month-old C57BL/6 male mice were either sham irradiated or received whole-body high energy proton irradiation at an acute single dose of 0.5 Gy or 12 equal dose fractions for a total dose of 0.5 Gy over twenty-five days. At four months following irradiation, mice were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected for histochemical analysis. Significant increases in the number of apoptotic cells were documented in the mouse retinas and ONHs that received proton radiation with a single or fractionated dose ( p < 0.05). Immunochemical analysis revealed enhanced immunoreactivity for oxidative biomarker, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in the retina and ONH following single or fractionated protons with more pronounced changes observed with a single dose of 0.5 Gy. BRB integrity was also evaluated with biomarkers of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4), a water channel protein, a tight junction (TJ) protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), and an adhesion molecule, the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1). A significantly increased expression of AQP-4 was observed in the retina following a single dose exposure compared to controls. There was also a significant increase in the expression of PECAM-1 and a decrease in the expression of ZO-1 in the retina. These changes give a strong indication of disturbance to BRB integrity in the retina. Interestingly, there was very limited immunoreactivity of AQP-4 and ZO-1 seen in the ONH region, pointing to possible lack of BRB properties as previously reported. Our data demonstrated that exposure to proton radiation of 0.5 Gy induced oxidative stress-associated apoptosis in the retina and ONH, and changes in BRB integrity in the retina. Our study also revealed the differences in BRB biomarker distribution between these two regions. In response to radiation insults, the cellular response in the retina and ONH may be differentially regulated in acute or hyperfractionated dose schedules.",1. Introduction,2. Material and Methods,3.

Within 20 h after splashdown, IOP and ERG assessments were repeated before euthanasia. There were significant increases in body weight for habitat control groups post-flight compared to pre-flight measurements. However, the body weights were similar among flight groups before launch and after splashdown. The IOP measurements were similar between pre- and post-flight groups with no significant differences between BuOE-treated and saline controls. Immunofluorescence evaluation showed increases in retinal oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death after spaceflight. BuOE treatment significantly decreased the level of the oxidative stress biomarker. ERG data showed that the average amplitudes of the a- and b-wave were significantly decreased (39% and 32% by spaceflight, respectively) compared to that of habitat ground controls.

Based on their colony morphology, two strains that showed yeast-like appearance were further characterized for their phylogenetic position. The species-level classification of these two novel strains, using traditional colony and cell morphology methods combined with the phylogenetic reconstructions using multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) based on several gene loci (ITS, LSU, SSU, RPB 1, RPB2 , CYTB and TEF1 ), and whole genome sequencing (WGS) was carried out. This polyphasic taxonomic approach supported the conclusion that the two basidiomycetous yeasts belong to hitherto undescribed species. The strain FJI-L2-BK-P3 T , isolated from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Spacecraft Assembly Facility, was placed in the Naganishia albida clade (Filobasidiales, Tremellomycetes), but is genetically and physiologically different from other members of the clade. Another yeast strain FKI-L6-BK-PAB1 T , isolated from the Kennedy Space Center Payload Hazardous and Servicing Facility, was placed in the genus Cystobasidium ( Cystobasidiales, Cystobasidiomycetes ) and is distantly related to C. benthicum.

Despite advances, there remains much to learn about human adaptation to spaceflight's unique challenges, including microgravity, immune system perturbations, and radiation exposure. Methods To provide a detailed genetics analysis of the mission, we collected dried blood spots pre-, during, and post-flight for DNA extraction. Telomere length was measured by quantitative PCR, while whole genome and cfDNA sequencing provided insight into genomic stability and immune adaptations. A robust bioinformatic pipeline was used for data analysis, including variant calling to assess mutational burden. Result Telomere elongation occurred during spaceflight and shortened after return to Earth. Cell-free DNA analysis revealed increased immune cell signatures post-flight. No significant clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) or whole-genome instability was observed. The long-term gene expression changes across immune cells suggested cellular adaptations to the space environment persisting months post-flight.

Telomeric RNA, or TERRA, is a previously presumed long noncoding RNA of heterogeneous lengths that contributes to end-capping structure and function, and facilitates telomeric recombination in tumors that maintain telomere length via the telomerase-independent Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) pathway. Here, we investigated TERRA in the radiation-induced DNA damage response (DDR) across astronauts, high-altitude climbers, healthy donors, and cellular models. Similar to astronauts in the space radiation environment and climbers of Mt. Everest, in vitro radiation exposure prompted increased transcription of TERRA, while simulated microgravity did not. Data suggest a specific TERRA DDR to telomeric double-strand breaks (DSBs), and provide direct demonstration of hybridized TERRA at telomere-specific DSB sites, indicative of protective TERRA:telomeric DNA hybrid formation. Targeted telomeric DSBs also resulted in accumulation of TERRA foci in G2-phase, supportive of TERRA’s role in facilitating recombination-mediated telomere elongation.

Our findings reveal significant variations in globin gene expression corresponding to the distinct spatiotemporal characteristics of the collected samples. This study sheds light on the dynamic nature of globin gene regulation in response to the space environment and provides valuable insights into the broader implications of space omics research.",Introduction,Methods,Results,Discussion,,,Spatiotemporal expression and control of haemoglobin in space,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166948/,

One of the areas of research is the development of technologies for independent production of food by the crew. Extensive research on lettuce has confirmed that the “space production” of lettuce is not inferior to that on Earth, even in the absence of gravity, but the same deep understanding of the quality of grain crops has not yet been achieved. Therefore, the goal of our work is to establish whether the conditions for growing wheat in outer space without gravity affect the weight and basic parameters of the grain, and whether this leads to increased asymmetry of the kernel and distortion of the starch composition. The objects of the study were wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) kernels of the Super Dwarf cultivar. Of which, 100 kernels matured in outer space conditions in the Lada growth chamber on the International Space Station (ISS), and 85 kernels of the control wheat grown in a similar growth chamber under terrestrial conditions. It has been established that kernels from ISS have significant differences to a smaller extent in weight, area, length, and width of the kernel. However, the kernels under both conditions were predominantly large (the average weight of a kernel in space is 0.0362 g, and in terrestrial conditions—0.0376 g). The hypothesis that the level of fluctuating asymmetry will increase in outer space was not confirmed; significant differences between the options were not proven. In general, the kernels are fairly even (coefficients of variation for the main parameters of the kernel are within 6–12%) and with a low or very low level of asymmetry. The length of starch granules of type A in filled and puny kernels is significantly greater in kernels from ISS than in the control, and in terms of the width of starch granules B and roundness indices, both experimental variants are the same. It can be assumed that the baking qualities of earthly kernels will be slightly higher, since the ratio of type B starch granules to type A is 5–8% higher than on the ISS. Also, the width of the aleurone layer cells in mature kernels was significantly inferior to the result obtained on Earth. The work proposes a new method for establishing the asymmetry of kernels without a traumatic effect (in early works, it was supposed to study asymmetry in transverse sections of the kernels). Perhaps this will make it possible to further develop a computer scanning program that will determine the level of asymmetry of the wheat fruit.",1. Introduction,2.2.

Multiple plantings were grown on ISS and harvested using either a single, final harvest, or sequential harvests in which several mature leaves were removed from the plants at weekly intervals. Ground controls were grown simultaneously with a 24–72 h delay using ISS environmental data. Food safety of the plants was determined by heterotrophic plate counts for bacteria and fungi, as well as isolate identification using samples taken from the leaves and roots. Molecular characterization was conducted using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to provide taxonomic composition and phylogenetic structure of the community. Leaves were also analyzed for elemental composition, as well as levels of phenolics, anthocyanins, and Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC).

Assays were performed on two different microbial assemblages sampled from freshwater bodies of two contrasting turbidity status: clear (chlorophyll a = 7.6 μgL -1 , turbidity = 1 NTU) and organic turbid systems (chlorophyll a = 25.0 μgL -1 , turbidity = 9 NTU). For each system, the herbicide was applied to 500 mL-Erlenmeyer flasks, at seven concentration levels of the active ingredient (a.i.): 0 (control = no addition), 0.02, 0.2, 2, 20, 200 and 2,000 mg a.i.L −1 . The impact of AsiMax 50® seemed to be greater in the turbid system. In this system, total abundance of living (live) micro + nano phytoplankton showed a significant increase at lower concentrations and data were fitted to a humped-shaped curve. For both clear and organic turbid systems, micro + nano phytoplankton decreased in species richness and abundance at higher herbicide concentrations. These results suggest that 2,4-D may mimic hormonal function. Some species, such as Ochromonas sp. and Chlamydomonas sp., showed different responses to herbicide exposure between water systems. In the turbid system, the increase in abundance of the PPP fraction observed at 7-d exposure was probably due to either an increase in PE-Pcy (thus suggesting the existence of auxin pathways) or a reduction in competitive pressure by micro + nano plankton. Our results provide some evidence of the importance of using community-scale approaches in ecotoxicological studies to predict changes in freshwater ecosystems exposed to a 2,4-D-based formulation.

We show that the OsCRW1-EIN3 LIKE 1 and 2 (OsEIL1/2)-ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 82 (OsERF82) module controls the production of reactive oxygen species in the root tip, subsequently impacting root cap stability, polar localization of PIN-FORMED 2 (OsPIN2), symmetric distribution of auxin, and ultimately gravitropic growth of roots. The OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 ethylene signaling module is effectively impeded by applying gentle mechanical resistance to root tips, including growing in water-saturated paddy soil. We further show that mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling is required and sufficient for antagonizing the ethylene signaling pathway.

However, the molecular mechanisms that govern the regulation of root growth by cadaverine are largely unexplored. Here we conducted a forward genetic screen and isolated a mutation, cadaverine hypersensitive 3 ( cdh3 ), which resulted in increased root‐growth sensitivity to cadaverine, but not other polyamines. This mutation affects the BIO3‐BIO1 biotin biosynthesis gene. Exogenous supply of biotin and a pathway intermediate downstream of BIO1, 7,8‐diaminopelargonic acid, suppressed this cadaverine sensitivity phenotype. An in vitro enzyme assay showed cadaverine inhibits the BIO3‐BIO1 activity. Furthermore, cadaverine‐treated seedlings displayed reduced biotinylation of Biotin Carboxyl Carrier Protein 1 of the acetyl‐coenzyme A carboxylase complex involved in de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, resulting in decreased accumulation of triacylglycerides. Taken together, these results revealed an unexpected role of cadaverine in the regulation of biotin biosynthesis, which leads to modulation of primary root growth of plants.",INTRODUCTION,,RESULTS,DISCUSSION,,,Cadaverine regulates biotin synthesis to modulate primary root growth in Arabidopsis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8518694/,

Our previous experiments indicated that low-speed clinorotation may itself trigger directional root tip curvature. In this project, we have investigated the root curvature response to low-speed clinorotation using Arabidopsis thaliana and Brachypodium distachyon seedlings as models. We show that low-speed clinorotation triggers root tip curvature in which direction is dictated by gravitropism during the first half-turn of clinorotation. We also show that the angle of root tip curvature is modulated by the speed of clinorotation. Arabidopsis mutations affecting gravity susception ( pgm ) or gravity signal transduction ( arg1 , toc132 ) are shown to affect the root tip curvature response to low-speed clinorotation. Furthermore, low-speed vertical clinorotation triggers relocalization of the PIN3 auxin efflux facilitator to the lateral membrane of Arabidopsis root cap statocytes, and creates a lateral gradient of auxin across the root tip. Together, these observations support a role for gravitropism in modulating root curvature responses to clinorotation. Interestingly, distinct Brachypodium distachyon accessions display different abilities to develop root tip curvature responses to low-speed vertical clinorotation, suggesting the possibility of using genome-wide association studies to further investigate this process.",1.

While rapid screening methods for microtiter plate well (“static”) biofilms are available, there are no methods for such screening of continuous flow biofilms (“flow biofilms”). Since the latter biofilms more closely approximate natural biofilms, development of a high-throughput (HTP) method for screening them is desirable. We describe here a new method using a device comprised of microfluidic channels and a distributed pneumatic pump (BioFlux) that provides fluid flow to 96 individual biofilms. This device allows fine control of continuous or intermittent fluid flow over a broad range of flow rates, and the use of a standard well plate format provides compatibility with plate readers. We show that use of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing bacteria, staining with propidium iodide, and measurement of fluorescence with a plate reader permit rapid and accurate determination of biofilm viability. The biofilm viability measured with the plate reader agreed with that determined using plate counts, as well as with the results of fluorescence microscope image analysis. Using BioFlux and the plate reader, we were able to rapidly screen the effects of several antimicrobials on the viability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 flow biofilms.",,,,,,,New device for high-throughput viability screening of flow biofilms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2897429/,

The σ s -regulated general stress response helps them become resistant to disinfectants, but the role of σ s in bacterial antibiotic resistance has not been elucidated. Loss of σ s rendered stationary-phase Escherichia coli more sensitive to the bactericidal antibiotic gentamicin (Gm), and proteomic analysis suggested involvement of a weakened antioxidant defense. Use of the p sfiA genetic reporter, 3′-( p -hydroxyphenyl) fluorescein (HPF) dye, and Amplex Red showed that Gm generated more reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mutant. HPF measurements can be distorted by cell elongation, but Gm did not affect stationary-phase cell dimensions. Coadministration of the antioxidant N -acetyl cysteine (NAC) decreased drug lethality particularly in the mutant, as did Gm treatment under anaerobic conditions that prevent ROS formation. Greater oxidative stress, due to insufficient quenching of endogenous ROS and/or respiration-linked electron leakage, therefore contributed to the greater sensitivity of the mutant; infection by a uropathogenic strain in mice showed this to be the case also in vivo . Disruption of antioxidant defense by eliminating the quencher proteins, SodA/SodB and KatE/SodA, or the pentose phosphate pathway proteins, Zwf/Gnd and TalA, which provide NADPH for ROS decomposition, also generated greater oxidative stress and killing by Gm. Thus, besides its established mode of action, Gm also kills stationary-phase bacteria by generating oxidative stress, and targeting the antioxidant defense of E. coli can enhance its efficacy. Relevant aspects of the current controversy on the role of ROS in killing by bactericidal drugs of exponential-phase bacteria, which represent a different physiological state, are discussed.",,,,,,,Sigma S-dependent antioxidant defense protects stationary-phase Escherichia coli against the bactericidal antibiotic gentamicin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4187989/,

One such mechanism is the formation of plasma membrane disruptions (PMD), which foster a molecular flux across cell membranes that promotes tissue adaptation. Repair of PMD through an orchestrated activity of molecular machinery is critical for cell survival, and the rate of PMD repair can affect downstream cellular signaling. PMD have been observed to influence the mechanical behavior of skin, alveolar, and gut epithelial cells, aortic endothelial cells, corneal keratocytes and epithelial cells, cardiac and skeletal muscle myocytes, neurons, and most recently, bone cells including osteoblasts, periodontal ligament cells, and osteocytes. PMD are therefore positioned to affect the physiological behavior of a wide range of vertebrate organ systems including skeletal and cardiac muscle, skin, eyes, the gastrointestinal tract, the vasculature, the respiratory system, and the skeleton. The purpose of this review is to describe the processes of PMD formation and repair across these mechanosensitive tissues, with a particular emphasis on comparing and contrasting repair mechanisms and downstream signaling to better understand the role of PMD in skeletal mechanobiology.

These multiple differences from those experienced on the earth may cause systemic and local tissue stress. Autonomic nerves, including sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, regulate functions in multiple organs. Saliva is secreted from the salivary gland, which is regulated by autonomic nerves, and plays several important roles in the oral cavity and digestive processes. The balance of the autonomic nervous system in the seromucous glands, such as the submandibular glands, precisely controls serous and mucous saliva. Psychological stress, radiation damage, and other triggers can cause an imbalance in salivary secretion systems. A previous study reported that amylase is a stress marker in behavioral medicine and space flight crews; however, the detailed mechanisms underlying amylase regulation in the space environment are still unknown. Methods: In this study, we aimed to elucidate how lunar gravity (1/6 g ) changes mRNA expression patterns in the salivary gland. Using a multiple artificial gravity research system during space flight in the International Space Station, we studied the effects of two different gravitational levels, lunar and Earth gravity, on the submandibular glands of mice. All mice survived, returned to Earth from space, and their submandibular glands were collected 2 days after landing. Results: We found that lunar gravity induced the expression of the salivary amylase gene Amy1 ; however, no increase in Aqp5 and Ano1 , which regulate water secretion, was observed. In addition, genes involved in the exocrine system, such as vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 ( Vamp8 ) and small G proteins, including Rap1 and Rab families, were upregulated under lunar gravity. Conclusion: These results imply that lunar gravity upregulates salivary amylase secretion via Rap / Rab signaling and exocytosis via Vamp8 . Our study highlights Amy1 as a potential candidate marker for stress regulation in salivary glands in the lunar gravity environment.",1 Introduction,2 Materials and methods,3 Results,4 Discussion,"4 Discussion In the 1/6 g lunar gravitational environment, Amy1 was upregulated in the submandibular glands, as were Vamp8 and the small G protein Rap1 ( Ras family)/ Rab2a , Rab10 , and Rab27 (Rab family) which are involved in vesicle secretion. Amylase has been identified as a stress marker in behavioral medicine and space flight crews ( Ali and Nater, 2020 ; Ghasemi et al., 2021 ). Vamp8 acts as a v-SNARE that regulates the secretion of the entire exocrine system ( Wang et al., 2007 ). Salivary proteins are synthesized in acinar cells. Based on the genetic information in acinar cells, salivary proteins are synthesized in ribosomes, pass through the rough endoplasmic reticulum, become vesicles, and are transported to the Golgi apparatus. Intravesicular proteins that undergo modifications, such as glycosylation, in the Golgi apparatus are concentrated and stored in secretory granules. Small G proteins such as Ras and Rab families function salivary secretion, as guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins with a molecular weight of 20–30 kDa. This hydrolysis results in inactive guanosine diphosphate (GDP). Small G proteins act as molecular switches that bind specific target molecules and transmit intracellular signals. GDP/GTP exchange proteins (GEF) are regulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). The combined GTP and GDP states function as molecular switches corresponding to the on/off states. Activity regulation is temporally and spatially controlled and functions as a biotimer. Small G proteins are classified into five families, and regulate various cellular functions. Rap / Rab signaling plays an important role in saliva and amylase secretion ( D'Silva et al., 1998 ; Sabbatini et al., 2008 ; Gomi et al., 2017 ). Our study showed no increase in the expression of mRNA related to receptors for noradrenaline secreted from sympathetic nerves involved in protein secretion, where is the upstream of salivary secretion system, while upregulations of Rap/Rab signaling for transporting intracellular vesicles and v-SNARE (Vamp8) to secrete amylase via exocytosis at apical side of acinar cells were observed in the 1/6 g environment. In addition, salivary secretion requires high levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) not only for salivary secretion by maintaining intracellular K + concentration in acinar cells, but also for modification of saliva by reabsorption and secretion in ductal cells of submandibular gland. Our GSEA data show that a set of mRNAs involved in oxidative phosphorylation was highly upregulated under 1/6 g lunar gravity in MHU-4 and -5. Plus, mRNAs in association of ionic transport coupled with ATP synthesis or hydrolysis were also upregulated at 1/6 g lunar gravity compared to that under 1 g in the MHU-4 and -5 missions. We also hypothesized that changes in gravity may induce changes in body fluids, resulting in excessive fluid inflow into the submandibular gland. Our data shows downregulation of mechanosensitive ion channels such as TRP , Piezo , and ASIC channels, however. Fluid balance fluctuates when gravity changes, shifting fluid to the upper body and creating a situation where the astronauts have edema around the salivary glands, which causes mechanical stress. It is possible that the mRNA levels of these mechanosensitive ion channels in the submandibular gland decrease because of a function that restores them to their normal state. In conclusion, our results indicate that changes in the gravitational environment induce qualitative changes in salivary secretion function and that multiple genes may be involved in maintaining salivary secretion homeostasis in the space environment. Overall, our data suggested that lunar gravity upregulates salivary amylase secretion via vesicular transport and exocytosis mediated by Rap/Rab signaling and Vamp8 at apical side of acinar cells ( Figure 11 ). However, we have not shown the functional assay as amylase secretion in this study. To clarify the correlation mechanisms between these mRNAs and amylase secretion, it will need to be verified whether any effect on amylase secretion is caused by both gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments in acinar cells. Further research on salivary secretion signal and gene regulation may contribute to the future monitoring of the physical and mental health of humans living in space as well as the improvement of oral medicine.

Specifically, space radiation may contribute to decreased immunity, which has been documented in astronauts during short- and long-duration missions, as evidenced by several changes in cellular immunity and plasma cytokine levels. Reactivation of latent herpes viruses, either directly from radiation of latently infected cells and/or from perturbation of the immune system, may result in disease in astronauts. Epstein‒Barr virus (EBV) is one of the eight human herpes viruses known to infect more than 90% of human adults and persists for the life of the host without normally causing adverse effects. Reactivation of several latent viruses in astronauts is well documented, although the mechanism of reactivation is not well understood. We studied the effect of four different types of radiation, (1) 137 Cs gamma rays, (2) 150-MeV protons, (3) 600 MeV/n carbon ions, and (4) 600 MeV/n iron ions on the activation of lytic gene transcription and of reactivation of EBV in a latently infected cell line (Akata) at doses of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy. The data showed that for all doses used in this study, lytic gene transcription was induced and median viral loads were significantly higher for all types of radiation than in corresponding control samples, with the increases detected as early as four days post-exposure and generally tapering off at later time points. The viability and size of EBV-infected Akata cells were highly variable and exhibited approximately the same trend in time for all radiation types at 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy. This work shows that reactivation of viruses can occur due to the effect of different types of radiation on latently infected cells in the absence of changes or cytokines produced in the immune system. In general, gamma rays are more effective than protons, carbon ions, and iron ions in inducing latent virus reactivation, though these high-energy particles did induce more sustained and later reactivation of EBV lytic gene transcription. These findings also challenge the common relative biological effectiveness concept that is often used in radiobiology for other end points.",1. Introduction,4. Materials and Methods,2. Results,3.

In order to understand this, the salivary microbiome was analyzed with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and saliva viral titers were analyzed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with primers specific for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) from 10 astronauts pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight. Results Streptococcus was the most abundant organism in the saliva, making up 8% of the total organisms detected, and their diversity decreased during spaceflight. Other organisms that had statistically significant changes were Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria which increased during flight and Actinobacteria which decreased during flight. At the genus level, Catonella , Megasphera , and Actinobacillus were absent in more than half of saliva samples collected pre-flight but were then detected during flight. In those subjects that already had these genera pre-flight, their relative abundances increased during flight. Correlation analyses between the microbiome and viral titers revealed a positive correlation with Gracilibacteria , Absconditabacteria , and Abiotrophia and a negative correlation between Oribacterium , Veillonella , and Haemophilus . There was also a significant positive correlation between microbiome richness and EBV viral titers.

Cell divisions in the meristem and rapid cell growth in the elongation zone propel the root tips through the soil. Actively elongating cells acidify their apoplast to enable cell wall extension by the activity of plasma membrane AHA H + -ATPases. The phytohormone auxin, central regulator of gravitropic response and root development, inhibits root cell growth, likely by rising the pH of the apoplast. However, the role of auxin in the regulation of the apoplastic pH gradient along the root tip is unclear. Here, we show, by using an improved method for visualization and quantification of root surface pH, that the Arabidopsis thaliana root surface pH shows distinct acidic and alkaline zones, which are not primarily determined by the activity of AHA H + -ATPases. Instead, the distinct domain of alkaline pH in the root transition zone is controlled by a rapid auxin response module, consisting of the AUX1 auxin influx carrier, the AFB1 auxin co-receptor, and the CNCG14 calcium channel.

For PIN2>>AHA2delta95, we cloned the CDS 1-886 of AHA2 (AT4G30190) lacking the last 95 amino acids as in Pacheco-Villalobos et al., 2016 , and fused mScarlet-I ( Bindels et al., 2017 ) to the C-terminal part. For PIN2>>PP2C-D1, we cloned the CDS of PP2C-D1 (AT5G02760) and fused mScarlet-I to the C-terminal part. Both constructs were cloned downstream of the 4xLexA Operon fused to CaMV 35S minimal promoter ( Sarrion-Perdigones et al., 2013 ) and the transcriptional units were terminated by the 35S terminator and cloned into the alpha1-3 vectors ( Dusek et al., 2020 ). XVE ( Zuo et al., 2000 ) was cloned under the control of the PIN2 promoter (1.4 kb upstream of the AT5G57090), terminated by the RuBisCo terminator from Pisum sativum and the resulting transcriptional unit was cloned into alpha1-1 vector. The alpha transcriptional units were then interspaced with matrix attachment regions ( Dusek et al., 2020 ), combined with a Basta resistance cassette and introduced into the pDGB3omega1 binary vector ( Sarrion-Perdigones et al., 2013 ). The CNGC14::CNGC14-GFP construct contains the CNCG14 promoter (1.5 kb upstream of the start codon) and the CNGC14 coding sequence (the AT2G24610.1 splice variant) with the GFP fused to the C-terminus and 35S terminator. This transcriptional unit was combined with a kanamycin resistance cassette and FastRed marker for rapid selection of transgenic seeds into the pDGB3omega1 binary vector. All cloning steps were performed using the GoldenBraid methodology ( Sarrion-Perdigones et al., 2013 ; https://gbcloning.upv.es/ ). Col-0 ecotype (PIN2>>AHA2delta95, PIN2>>PP2C-D1) or cngc14-1 and cngc14-2 lines (CNGC14-mVenus) were transformed using the floral dip method ( Clough and Bent, 1998 ). Pharmacological treatments and dyes Treatments were prepared using the following chemicals: IAA (10 mM stock in ethanol; Sigma-Aldrich), FC (1 mM stock in ethanol; Sigma-Aldrich), estradiol (20 mM stock in DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich). Fluorescein Dextran 10,000 MW, Anionic (D1821, Thermo Fisher) - 10 mg/ml stock in miliQ H 2 O, final concentration in media is 29 µg/ml. Oregon Green 488 Dextran, 10,000 MW (D7170, Invitrogen) - 1 mg/ml stock in miliQ H 2 O, final concentration in media is 2.5 µg/ml. HPTS (H1529, Sigma-Aldrich), 100 mM stock in H 2 O, final concentration in media is 1 mM. FS (F1130, Thermo Fisher), 100 or 50 mM stock in H 2 O, final concentration in media is 50 µM. Induction of PIN2>>AHA2delta95 and PIN2>>PP2C-D1 lines was done by incubating 5-day-old seedlings for 2.5 hr in 1/2 MS MES buffered media (g/l), 1% sucrose, pH 5.8 containing 2 µM estradiol before experiments. Measurement of FS excitation and emission spectra For measurement of fluorescent spectra of FS, ½ MS media with 1% sucrose were prepared with pH 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0 (adjusted with KOH). FS stock (50 mM in H 2 O) was added to the media to achieve a final concentration of 50 µM. For the measurement, 200 µl of this media was pipetted into a 96-well plate, five wells per each pH value and the spectras were measured using Spark multimode microplate reader (Tecan). The values for each pH were averaged and plotted. Measurement of FS range and effects of salts and redox status on FS signal To demonstrate the wide pH-reporting range of FS ( Figure 1c ), citric acid and sodium citrate were mixed in various ratios and water was added to obtain citrate buffers with a range of pH values. The pH of citrate buffers was measured, the buffers were mixed with agar (0.8% final concentration), boiled and FS was added (50 µM final concentration). The mixture was poured into a Petri dish. After cooling down, slabs of the solidified buffers were cut out, and placed into imaging chambers. To measure the effects of ions and redox status (according to Martinière et al., 2013 ) on FS fluorescence ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1e ), MES buffer (1 g/l) was prepared and boiled with agar (1% final concentration), supplied with salts, H 2 O 2 , DTT, and FS was added (50 µM final concentration). The mixture was poured into a Petri dish. After cooling down, slabs of the solidified buffers were cut out, placed into imaging chambers and imaged using a spinning disk microscope, see Imaging of root surface pH. The signal intensity was measured in both 405 and 488 nm excitation channels and F 488/405 ratio was calculated. Imaging of root surface pH For imaging of surface pH, 5-day-old seedlings were transferred to unbuffered ½ MS, 1% sucrose, pH 5.7 (adjusted with KOH) containing 50 µM of FS +/-treatments and allowed for recovery 25 min before imaging. The medium was prepared as follows: For 100 ml of medium, 1 g of plant agar and 1 g sucrose (wt/vol) were added to 100 ml of unbuffered ½ MS in a 250 ml reagent bottle. The media was boiled until the agar was completely dissolved. Note: we always prepared a fresh solid medium for each experiment from a stock of liquid ½ MS, sucrose and agar, as re-boiling the medium might affect the results. The medium was cooled to a temperature of 45–50°C and FS was added to achieve 50 μM concentration. This pre-solution was then divided into two equal volumes to make control and treatment medium. For the gravitropic experiments, the seedlings were rotated ±90°. Only roots with a starting angle of 90°±10° were selected for analysis to obtain homogeneous gravitropic stimulations. Surface pH imaging was performed using a vertical stage Zeiss Axio Observer 7 with Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 10×/0.8, coupled to a Yokogawa CSU-W1-T2 spinning disk unit with 50 µm pinholes and equipped with a VS401 HOM1000 excitation light homogenizer (Visitron Systems). Images were acquired using the VisiView software (Visitron Systems). FS was sequentially excited with a 488 and 405 nm laser and the emission was filtered by a 500–550 nm bandpass filter. Signal was detected using a PRIME-95B Back-Illuminated sCMOS Camera (1200×1200 pixels; Photometrics). The Flat field correction mode was used for image acquisition. For vertical growth experiments, seedlings were imaged every 10 min for 30 min. The profiles shown correspond to the first time frame while the root elongation was calculated over the whole experiment. Imaging to observe oscillations of the root surface pH was conducted by imaging every 5 s. For gravitropic experiments, seedlings were imaged using the sandwich method ( https://doi.org/10.1017/qpb.2022.4 ) every 2 min for 42 min. The profile shown corresponds to the last time frame except specified otherwise. The angles were quantified over the entire duration of the experiment. The images in Figure 4g were acquired using the Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope, with a 25×/0.8 water immersion objective using settings appropriate for the respective fluorophores. Immunolabeling of AHAs Whole mount immunolocalization of 5-day-old A. thaliana seedlings was performed as described previously in Sauer et al., 2006 , with the following modifications. The protocol was adapted to the InSituPro VS liquid-handling robot (Intavis AG, Germany). Prior to immunolocalization, seedlings were fixed 1 hr with 4% paraformaldehyde dissolved in MTSB (50 mM PIPES, 5 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O pH 7, adjusted with KOH) at room temperature. In the robot, procedure started with 5×15 min washes with MTSB-T (MTSB+0.01% Triton X-100) then the cell wall was digested by 30 min treatment at 37°C with 0.05% Pectolyase Y-23 supplemented with 0.4 M mannitol in MTSB-T, followed by 2×30 min membrane permeation with 10% DMSO and 3% Igepal in MTSB-T. The samples were blocked 1 hr with BSA (blocking solution: 2% BSA in MTSB-T) and incubated 4 hr at 37°C with primary (antiAHA rabbit antibody, Agrisera AS07260, RRID: AB_1031584 ) and 3 hr at 37°C with secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 555 goat, anti-rabbit, Abcam ab150078, RRID: AB_2722519 ). The antibodies were diluted in 2% BSA in MTSB-T in concentration: 1:500 for primary and 1:1000 for secondary antibody. Between the all described steps the seedlings were washed 5×15 min with MTSB-T. For the final step, MTSB-T was exchanged by deionized water. From the robot seedlings were transferred to microscopy slides into 50% glycerol in deionized water and fluorescence signal was imaged by Zeiss LSM 880 inverted confocal scanning microscope equipped with Airyscan detector with 40×/1.2 C-Apochromat objective. Mesh penetration test Four-day-old seedlings were transferred on ½ MS, 1% (wt/vol) plant agar, 1% (wt/vol) sucrose, pH 5.8, covered with sterilized nylon meshes of pore sizes of 109, 119, 139 µm (polyamide mesh UHELON). Plates were grown overnight vertically and then were tilted to 45° and grown 24 hr. After that, the root penetration through the mesh was scored using a binocular microscope. The penetration efficiency was calculated by normalizing each variant (genotype × pore size) to the Col-0 efficiency in the 139 µm variant in the particular repetition. In addition, the reference Col-0 was normalized to the Col-0 average over all repeats. Image analysis We determined root elongation by measuring the total root length increment between the first and last time frame divided by the number of minutes. The root length increment was measured with the segmented line in ImageJ/Fiji v1.53f51 ( Schindelin et al., 2012 ). The pH along the root was automatically measured from 10 to 25 pixels off the root surface using custom Python scripts (ATR v5, https://sourceforge.net/projects/atr-along-the-root , see Figure 1—figure supplement 1f ) averaging bins of 15*20 pixels from the fluorescence intensity of both 405 and 488 nM channels. Root angles over time were automatically measured using ACORBA v1.2 ( Serre and Fendrych, 2022 ). Fluorescence intensity of AFB1-mCitrine and CNGC14-GFP was measured as the signal intensity along a segmented line that covered the epidermal cell file using Fiji; the intensities were then binned to 10 µm bins and plotted. Statistical analysis and graphics The averages and SD of surface pH or alkalinization factor in function of the distance from the root tip were plotted using the Sourcecode1.py Python script. The root elongation boxplots and the associated statistics were performed using the Sourcecode2.R: R script. Statistical analyses were performed using the R software (R v4.0.2 and RStudio v1.3.1073). Boxplots represent the median and the first and third quartiles, and the whiskers extend to data points <1.5 interquartile range away from the first or third quartile; all data points are shown as individual dots. The results of the statistical tests are compiled in Supplemental statistics. The pH surface profiles and data represented as boxplots were statistically analyzed from genotype to genotype or condition to condition using the nparcomp package ( Konietschke et al., 2015 ). For two conditions or two genotypes comparisons, we used a non-parametric Student’s test. For multiple comparisons, we used a non-parametric multi comparison test. For the pH surface profiles, each independent data point (a bin of pixels at a defined distance from the root tip) for the control genotype or condition were compared the same data point from the other(s) genotype(s) or condition(s) using the Sourcecode3.R or Sourcecode4.R R scripts. The results of the statistical tests for all the figures are compiled in Source data 1 . Sample size and biological replicates were determined as the maximum number of roots fitting the microscopy chamber, this number being influenced by the number of conditions and genotypes for a given experiment. Experiment technical replicates were arbitrarily set to three replicates. Fluorescence values were measured blindly by fully automated scripts. Data depicted in this publication represent a pool of technical and biological replicates. No technical or biological replicates were excluded from this publication. Graphics were created with the R software or in Python (v3.8) with the Seaborn plugin (v0.11.2, https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.03021 ) and aesthetic modifications of the graphs (fonts, size) were modified in Inkscape (v1.0).","Additional information Competing interests No competing interests declared.

We find that prolonged NF-κB activation in MuSCs in chronic injuries leads to shortened telomeres and Ku80 dysregulation and results in severe skeletal muscle defects.

Here, we demonstrate that quiescent MuSCs are morphologically heterogeneous and exhibit different patterns of cellular protrusions. We classified quiescent MuSCs into three functionally distinct stem cell states: responsive, intermediate, and sensory. We demonstrate that the shift between different stem cell states promotes regeneration and is regulated by the sensing protein Piezo1. Pharmacological activation of Piezo1 is sufficient to prime MuSCs toward more responsive cells. Piezo1 deletion in MuSCs shifts the distribution toward less responsive cells, mimicking the disease phenotype we find in dystrophic muscles. We further demonstrate that Piezo1 reactivation ameliorates the MuSC morphological and regenerative defects of dystrophic muscles.

PMC10264680,10.3389/fpls.2023.1171957,The EXO70 inhibitor Endosidin2 alters plasma membrane protein composition in Arabidopsis roots,Frontiers in Plant Science,2023,"Li, X; Zhu, P; Chen, Y; Huang, L; Wang, D; Newton, D; Hsu, C; Lin, G; Tao, W; Staiger, C; Zhang, C","To sustain normal growth and allow rapid responses to environmental cues, plants alter the plasma membrane protein composition under different conditions presumably by regulation of delivery, stability, and internalization. Exocytosis is a conserved cellular process that delivers proteins and lipids to the plasma membrane or extracellular space in eukaryotes. The octameric exocyst complex contributes to exocytosis by tethering secretory vesicles to the correct site for membrane fusion; however, whether the exocyst complex acts universally for all secretory vesicle cargo or just for specialized subsets used during polarized growth and trafficking is currently unknown. In addition to its role in exocytosis, the exocyst complex is also known to participate in membrane recycling and autophagy. Using a previously identified small molecule inhibitor of the plant exocyst complex subunit EXO70A1, Endosidin2 (ES2), combined with a plasma membrane enrichment method and quantitative proteomic analysis, we examined the composition of plasma membrane proteins in the root of Arabidopsis seedlings, after inhibition of the ES2-targetted exocyst complex, and verified our findings by live imaging of GFP-tagged plasma membrane proteins in root epidermal cells. The abundance of 145 plasma membrane proteins was significantly reduced following short-term ES2 treatments and these likely represent candidate cargo proteins of exocyst-mediated trafficking. Gene Ontology analysis showed that these proteins play diverse functions in cell growth, cell wall biosynthesis, hormone signaling, stress response, membrane transport, and nutrient uptake. Additionally, we quantified the effect of ES2 on the spatial distribution of EXO70A1 with live-cell imaging. Our results indicate that the plant exocyst complex mediates constitutive dynamic transport of subsets of plasma membrane proteins during normal root growth.",Introduction,Materials and methods,Results,Discussion,"Results Plasma membrane enrichment We chose to use a transgenic line expressing PIP2A-GFP as the plant material for our experiments because PIP2A-GFP is localized predominantly at the plasma membrane by microscopy and its cellular localization is not affected by 2 h of 40 μM ES2 treatment ( Cutler et al., 2000 ; Zhang et al., 2016 ). The GFP tag also allowed the use of anti-GFP antibody to examine the quality of enriched plasma membrane fractions. Six-day-old PIP2A-GFP seedlings were treated with either 40 μM ES2 or 0.5% DMSO for 2 h, a condition in which plant exocytosis is reduced but not completely inhibited ( Zhang et al., 2016 ). After treatment, roots were excised and used for plasma membrane enrichment ( Figure 1A ). We adapted a protocol that allows quick enrichment of plasma membrane and does not require large amounts of plant tissue ( Zhang and Peck, 2011 ; Collins et al., 2017 ). Figure 1 Characterization of enriched plasma membrane fractions shows the high quality of the sample preparation. (A) Flowchart of sample preparation for mass spectrometry analysis. (B) Western blot characterization of enriched plasma membrane fractions. Protein amount of 12.5 μg from total protein (total), soluble protein (sup.), crude membrane fraction (crude M.) and enriched plasma membrane fraction (e.PM) was separated in SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane. The same membrane was blotted with anti-GFP, anti-Sec12 and anti-SYP41 antibodies. (C) The Venn diagram comparing the proteins that were identified from different proteomics experiments. Enrichment was evaluated by detecting the presence of proteins known to localize to the plasma membrane (PIP2A-GFP) ( Cutler et al., 2000 ), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Sec12) ( Bar-Peled and Raikhel, 1997 ), and Golgi/trans-Golgi network (TGN) (SYP41) ( Bassham et al., 2000 ) in different fractions using Western blots with anti-GFP, anti-Sec12, and anti-SYP41 antibodies, respectively ( Figure 1B ). PIP2A-GFP was enriched in the plasma membrane fraction when compared to the crude membrane fraction ( Figure 1B , anti-GFP). The ER membrane protein, Sec12, was detected in both crude membrane and plasma membrane fractions; however, the abundance of Sec12 in the plasma membrane fraction was markedly lower than the crude membrane fraction ( Figure 1B , anti-Sec12). The Golgi/TGN protein, SYP41, was detected in the crude membrane fraction but not in the enriched plasma membrane fraction ( Figure 1B , anti-SYP41). Immunoblots demonstrated that although proteins from other organelles were present in the enriched plasma membrane fraction, their abundance was substantially reduced in comparison with plasma membrane proteins. We prepared four independent biological replicates of enriched plasma membrane fractions for the mass spectrometry proteomics analysis. Mass spectrometry analyses of enriched plasma membrane proteins From each enriched plasma membrane fraction, 25 μg of protein was digested with Lys-C and trypsin. Resulting peptides from ES2-treated plant samples were dimethyl labeled with 12 CH 2 O (light, L) and peptides from DMSO-treated samples were dimethyl labeled with 13 CD 2 O (heavy, H). Dimethyl-labeled peptides from ES2-treatment and control samples were combined and fractionated before LC-MS/MS analysis. The peptides that were detected by LC-MS/MS were assigned to proteins and the abundance of each protein was calculated through a MaxQuant database search. The ratio of each protein’s abundance in differentially labeled samples was calculated using the same process. The data were processed further with the Perseus platform by filtering out rows with invalid values (potential contaminants, the reverse peptides, and peptides only identified by site) from the MaxQuant database search. We further filtered the data by removing proteins with less than three detected values in the four replicates. To compare the data from different replicates, the ratio of protein abundance between differentially labeled proteins was transformed to log 2 phase and further normalized by median subtraction and then analyzed by histogram ( Supplemental Figure S1 ). The normal distribution of log 2 phase of ratios centered by zero between differentially labeled proteins indicates that the majority of proteins that we detected were not altered by ES2 treatment. We detected 3675 proteins from four independent replicate experiments ( Supplementary Table S1 ). To further evaluate the plasma membrane preparation, we compared our protein list with those published from different Arabidopsis tissues using another plasma membrane preparation method ( Figure 1C ). First, we compared our plasma membrane protein list with one generated from two-week-old liquid cultured Arabidopsis seedlings using a two-phase partition of microsomes and Trypsin-catalyzed 18 O labeling ( Nelson et al., 2006 ). We found 295 overlapping proteins, accounting for 95% of the proteins detected in Nelson et al.’s experiments (309 proteins in total) ( Figure 1C ). Elmore et al. used an aqueous two-phase partitioning approach for leaves of four-week-old Arabidopsis plants grown in soil condition and consistently identified more than 1300 proteins in replicate experiments ( Elmore et al., 2012 ). We found 960 overlapping proteins, accounting for more than 70% of the proteins detected in Elmore et al.’s experiments ( Figure 1C ). Li et al. isolated plasma membrane fractions from Arabidopsis suspension-cultured cells using a two-phase partition method and identified over 600 proteins by proteomic analysis ( Li et al., 2012 ). About 60% of the proteins that were detected from cultured cells were consistently identified in our experiments ( Figure 1C ). Substantial overlap between our plasma membrane protein list and others that use a different method or tissue indicates that our proteomic data can be used to compare the effects of ES2 on the abundance of plasma membrane proteins. To examine whether the enriched plasma membrane fraction was free from contaminants from other large membrane-bound compartments, we checked our proteomics list for the presence of proteins residing in the nuclear envelope and vacuole. The nuclear envelope protein SAD1/UNC-84 DOMAIN PROTEIN 1 (SUN1, AT5G04990; Oda and Fukuda, 2011 ) was detected, but its abundance was unchanged following ES2 treatment, with a mean log2 fold-change of 0.00. Another nuclear envelope protein SAD1/UNC-84 DOMAIN PROTEIN 2 (SUN2, AT3G10730; Oda and Fukuda, 2011 ) was not detected. The vacuole membrane protein TONOPLAST INTRINSIC PROTEIN 1;1 (γ-TIP or TIP1;1, AT2G36830; Nelson et al., 2006 ) was not detected. These results indicate that the enriched plasma membrane fraction was relatively free from contamination of nuclear envelope or vacuolar membranes. To investigate whether ES2 treatment altered the membrane identity of the plasma membrane fraction, we checked our proteomics list for the presence of several markers of membrane-bound organelles. The autophagosome markers ATG8e (AT2G45170) and ATG8f (AT4G16520) were not detected. The early endosome marker ARA6 (AT3G54840; Ebine et al., 2011 ), ER marker SEC12 (AT2G04170; Bar-Peled and Raikhel, 1997 ), and Golgi marker SYP32 (AT3G24350) and ALPHA-MANNOSIDASE 1 (ManI, AT1G51590; Kajiura et al., 2010 ) were all present but unchanged following ES2 treatment, with a mean log2 fold-change of 0.06 for ARA6, 0.05 for SEC12, 0.00 for SYP32, and -0.01 for ManI ( Supplementary Table S1 ). These results indicate that the membrane identify of the plasma membrane was not altered following ES2 treatment. To identify proteins with altered abundance after ES2 treatment, we performed a moderated t-test ( Smyth, 2004 ) for each protein using the limma package in R. The moderated t-test uses a hierarchical empirical Bayesian model to shrink the sample standard deviation estimates for each protein towards a pooled value. This stabilizes the t-statistics and increases the power of the test to detect true differences in protein abundance. Since multiple significance tests were performed, we used the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to bound the expected false-discovery rate at 10%. After the correction, 330 proteins had adjusted p-values less than 0.10. Thus, we can estimate that roughly 300 of the 330 proteins have log 2 ratios significantly different from 0. Among these 330 proteins, 145 had reduced abundance ( Supplementary Tables S2 , S3 ) and 185 had increased abundance ( Supplementary Table S4 ) in the plasma membrane fraction of ES2-treated samples. To highlight the proteins with the most dramatic changes, the top twenty proteins with decreased and increased abundance were listed in Tables 1 , 2 , respectively. Because ES2 binds to the EXO70A1 subunit of the exocyst complex and inhibits its function ( Zhang et al., 2016 ), and because EXO70A1 serves as a landmark for exocyst complex recruitment to the plasma membrane ( Synek et al., 2021 ), we expect that proteins with reduced abundance at the plasma membrane are candidate cargos of exocyst-mediated trafficking.

Confocal imaging of GFP-tagged plasma membrane proteins following ES2 treatment To confirm the identification of proteins with reduced abundance after ES2 treatment, we performed live imaging of GFP-tagged plasma membrane proteins in Arabidopsis root epidermal cells using laser scanning confocal microscopy ( Figure 2 ). We selected three protein candidates: the auxin efflux carrier protein PIN-FORMED 2 (PIN2), the leucine-rich-repeat receptor kinase of brassinosteroid signaling BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1), and the receptor kinase FERONIA (FER), each of which had reduced plasma membrane abundance after ES2 treatment in our proteomics analysis. PIN2 had a mean log2 fold-change of -0.27, BRI1 had a mean log2 fold-change of -0.31, and FER had a mean log2 fold-change of -0.38. ( Supplementary Table S1 ). We quantified GFP-tagged protein fluorescence intensity on the plasma membrane and normalized by subtracting the mean background fluorescence intensity from a cytoplasmic compartment-free region ( Figure 2C ). The abundance of all three proteins at the plasma membrane region were significantly decreased after a 2-h ES2 treatment ( Figure 2D ). To further evaluate the change of abundance between the plasma membrane and entire cytoplasmic region, we also quantified the plasma membrane / cytoplasm intensity ratio as another indicator of plasma membrane protein abundance ( Figure 2E ). The plasma membrane / cytoplasm intensity ratios for all three proteins were significantly reduced after a 2-h ES2 treatment compared to mock treatment ( Figure 2E ). Our analysis showed for the first time that the plasma membrane abundance of FER was decreased following ES2 treatment. As a negative control, we measured the abundance of PLASMA MEMBRANE INTRINSIC PROTEIN 2A (PIP2A), which was shown to have unaltered plasma membrane abundance after ES2 treatment in the proteomics analyses, with a mean log2 fold-change of 0.05 ( Supplementary Table S1 ). The plasma membrane abundance and plasma membrane / cytoplasm intensity ratio of PIP2A-GFP were not altered by ES2 treatment ( Figures 2D, E ). Figure 2 The abundance of several proteins at the plasma membrane is reduced following ES2 treatment.

In the box plot, whiskers indicate the maximum and minimum values of the dataset, whereas individual data points represent the average value from each seedling. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of candidate cargos for ES2-targeted trafficking To better understand the biological functions of the candidate cargo proteins for ES2-targeted trafficking, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the biological processes category on the 145 proteins with reduced abundance at the plasma membrane using the PANTHER classification system ( Mi et al., 2013 ; Mi et al., 2017 ). We found that 49 proteins could be classified into protein families that were enriched in abundance on our list when compared to their abundance in the reference list of Arabidopsis thaliana genome ( Figure 3 ). The fold enrichment for different biological processes ranged from 3.7 to 200. The 49 candidate exocytosis cargo proteins belong to gene families that function in plant cell growth, cell wall biosynthesis, hormone signaling, response to stresses and membrane transport ( Figure 3 ; Supplementary Table S2 ). The proteins for the regulation of DNA-templated transcription (GO:0006355), nucleic acid metabolic process (GO:0090304) and gene expression (GO:0010467) were much lower than the numbers that were expected from the Arabidopsis genome ( Figure 3 ), indicating the trafficking of these proteins was not mediated by the exocyst complex. Figure 3 Gene Ontology terms of biological processes category that are enriched in our protein list with significantly reduced abundance after ES2 treatment. Numbers on each row represent: fold enrichment (total number of proteins in the category/number of proteins identified in the reduced protein list/number of proteins expected in reduced protein list). Fold enrichment represents the ratio of the number of proteins identified divided by the number of proteins expected in the list. We further examined the annotated functions of proteins with significantly reduced abundance in ES2-treated samples. We found the abundance of three primary cell wall cellulose synthases (CESA1, CESA3, and CESA6), CELLULOSE SYNTHASE-INTERACTIVE PROTEIN 1 (CSI1), and KORRIGAN (KOR) was significantly reduced in ES2-treated samples ( Supplementary Table S2 ). Proteins involved in lignin metabolism were also reduced, as were multiple proteins involved in brassinosteroid and auxin signaling. The abundance of some proteins that respond to cold and phosphate deficiency was significantly reduced in ES2-treated samples. Another group of proteins that was affected by ES2 treatment are transporters responsible for the movement of phosphate, sulphate, potassium, and oligopeptides across the plasma membrane. The abundance of two annexins involved in phloem sucrose unloading ( Wang et al., 2018 ) was also significantly reduced ( Supplementary Table S2 ). In addition to the proteins mentioned above, there are other proteins with reduced abundance at the plasma membrane, but they were not enriched in functional groups in the GO enrichment analysis. These include multiple receptor-like protein kinases, transporters, enzymes for carbohydrate metabolism and protein glycosylation, as well as proteins with uncharacterized functions. Although these proteins were not enriched in our list, they may have diverse functions and cellular localization patterns among different members of the family. Collectively, our GO term enrichment analysis indicates that the exocyst complex mediates constitutive transport of numerous proteins that function in cell growth, cell wall biosynthesis, hormone signaling, stress response, and membrane transport. Bioinformatic analysis of potential cargo proteins for plant exocyst complex Plants use both conventional and unconventional trafficking pathways to deliver proteins to the plasma membrane and extracellular space ( Drakakaki and Dandekar, 2013 ; Ding et al., 2014 ; Robinson et al., 2016 ; Aniento et al., 2022 ). In the conserved conventional trafficking pathway, proteins with a signal peptide are inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum during translation and are then transported to Golgi through vesicles and further secreted through post-Golgi vesicles ( Novick et al., 1981 ; Rothman, 2002 ; Schekman, 2010 ). However, increasing evidence from proteomic analysis shows that many proteins that are secreted out of the cell or targeted to the plasma membrane do not have signal peptides, indicating the existence of unconventional trafficking pathways for these proteins ( Oh et al., 2005 ; Soares et al., 2007 ; Wen et al., 2007 ; Han et al., 2010 ; Chen et al., 2016 ). Plant exocyst complex has been shown to regulate cargo proteins through both conventional and unconventional pathways ( Wang et al., 2010 ; Drdová et al., 2013 ; Lin et al., 2015 ; Mayers et al., 2017 ). To test whether the candidate cargo proteins contain signal peptides that allow them to traffic through the conventional pathway, we analyzed the presence of signal peptides in proteins that had reduced abundance in ES2-treated samples using the DeepTMHMM package, a deep-learning method for signal peptide and transmembrane domain prediction ( Hallgren et al., 2022 ). DeepTMHMM predicted that 36 of the 145 proteins with reduced abundance contained signal peptides ( Supplementary Table S5 ). The existence of a signal peptide in a small percentage of proteins indicates that consistent with previous findings, plant exocyst complex mediates the transport of proteins in both conventional and unconventional trafficking pathways. To understand how these candidate cargo proteins are associated to the plasma membrane, we analyzed the presence of potential transmembrane domains in these 145 proteins using the DeepTMHMM package. We found 64 of the 145 proteins were predicted to have at least one transmembrane domain ( Supplementary Table S5 ). The behavior of the exocyst complex and its regulators is different than candidate cargo proteins All eight subunits of the exocyst complex were detected in the enriched plasma membrane fractions ( Supplementary Table S1 ). However, we did not find a statistically significant reduction in their abundance in ES2-treated samples ( Supplementary Table S1 ). Among the eight exocyst subunits, only SEC3 showed a 13% reduction in the mean value after ES2 treatment but was not statistically different ( Supplementary Table S1 ). STOMATAL CYTOKINESIS-DEFECTIVE 1 (SCD1), a component of the candidate activator of plant RabE GTPase that regulates the exocyst complex ( Mayers et al., 2017 ), was detected in plasma membrane fractions but its abundance was not altered by ES2 treatment ( Supplementary Table S1 ). We identified 12 Syntaxins of Plants (SYP), SYP111, SYP121, SYP122, SYP132, SYP21, SYP22, SYP32, SYP43, SYP51, SYP52, SYP61, and SYP71, but none of these were statistically significantly reduced ( Supplementary Table S1 ). In summary, our proteomics results indicate that the abundance of candidate tSNARE proteins, together with the exocyst complex and the SCD complex, were not significantly affected by a 2-h, 40 μM ES2 treatment. Confocal imaging of GFP-EXO70A1 following ES2 treatment To investigate whether ES2 affects the spatial distribution or abundance at the plasma membrane of its target, EXO70A1, we performed live imaging of root epidermal cells from GFP-EXO70A1 seedlings using laser scanning confocal microscopy ( Figure 4 ). Consistent with previous findings ( Zhang et al., 2016 ; Larson et al., 2020 ; Synek et al., 2021 ), EXO70A1 in mock-treated epidermal cells showed a polarized distribution with highest abundance at the plasma membrane on the outer periclinal face, but was present at all six faces of the cell ( Figure 4A ). A 2-h, 40 µM ES2 treatment significantly reduced the abundance of EXO70A1 at the plasma membrane on the outer periclinal face ( Figures 4B, D ), and disrupted the polarized distribution of EXO70A1 at the outer periclinal face when fluorescence intensity was expressed as a ratio with the cytosolic region ( Figure 4E ) or as a ratio with the other faces of the same cell ( Figure 4F ). However, when EXO70A1 at the other three faces of the plasma membrane visible in medial optical sections, including the inner periclinal face and the two anticlinal faces (green line in Figure 4C ), was examined, the apparent abundance expressed as a ratio with cytosol was not affected by ES2 treatment ( Figure 4G ). When all four faces of the plasma membrane were combined and averaged, there was a modest decrease in the abundance of EXO70A1, but this was not statistically significant ( Figure 4H ). In total, a 2-h ES2 treatment had greatest effect on the polarized distribution of EXO70A1 and its association with the plasma membrane at the outer periclinal face of root epidermal cells, but a rather modest reduction in overall abundance at the plasma membrane on all faces of the cell. Figure 4 The abundance of EXO70A1 at the plasma membrane on the outer periclinal face is decreased following ES2 treatment.

Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of proteins with increased abundance after ES2 treatment Our statistical analysis identified 185 proteins with increased abundance in enriched plasma membrane fractions of ES2-treated samples ( Supplementary Table S4 ). To better understand the function of these proteins, we performed Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of the biological function category. We found that this list of proteins is enriched in biological functions of COPII-coated vesicle cargo loading, mRNA catabolic process, negative regulation of translation, proton membrane transport, aerobic respiration, leaf senescence, ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis, and amide biosynthesis process ( Supplementary Figure S3 ). The functional relationship between exocyst complex and these proteins has not been well characterized. We speculate that some of these proteins might be involved in cellular responses to the inhibition of exocytosis.","Discussion Exocyst complex mediates constitutive transport of proteins with diverse functions during plant growth and development Using quantitative and comparative proteomics analysis, we identified 145 proteins with significantly reduced abundance at the plasma membrane of Arabidopsis roots following ES2 treatment. Some of these proteins possess transmembrane domains and are likely integral membrane proteins delivered to the plasma membrane by secretion. The candidate proteins without a predicted transmembrane domain could be associated with the plasma membrane through lipid anchors, through interaction with other membrane proteins, or by association with polar head groups of the lipid bilayer. These candidates of exocyst-mediated trafficking perform functions in cell growth, cell wall biosynthesis, hormone signaling, stress responses, membrane transport, nutrient transport, and protein phosphorylation. The dynamics of many hormone-signaling proteins are well characterized; however, the role of exocyst complex in regulating their trafficking awaits further study. The functional diversity of proteins that are transported through the exocyst complex is consistent with the pleiotropic phenotypes observed in plants deficient for the exocyst complex ( Cole et al., 2005 ; Synek et al., 2006 ; Hála et al., 2008 ; Fendrych et al., 2010 ; Kulich et al., 2010 ; Wang et al., 2010 ; Pečenková et al., 2011 ; Drdová et al., 2013 ; Zhang et al., 2013 ; Kulich et al., 2015 ; Drdová et al., 2019 ; Ogura et al., 2019 ; Synek et al., 2021 ; Hématy et al., 2022 ). Our results indicate that the plant exocyst complex plays essential roles for growth and adaptation by mediating constitutive transport of proteins with diverse functions to the plasma membrane. Some other important plasma membrane proteins, such as Rho family small GTPases (ROPs), multidrug resistance-like ABC transporter family proteins, and aquaporin plasma membrane intrinsic proteins were not affected by ES2 treatment in this proteomics study ( Supplementary Table S1 ), which is consistent with the previous live-cell imaging results ( Zhang et al., 2016 ). Our current results indicate that these important plasma membrane proteins could have slow turnover rates or are not delivered to the plasma membrane through the ES2-targeted exocyst complex. Cargo protein exocytosis and exocyst complex membrane association Time-lapse imaging revealed that the plant exocyst complex colocalizes with its cargo protein (Cellulose Synthase Complex or CSC) during the tethering process and then separates from the cargo after successful fusion ( Zhu et al., 2018 ; Zhang and Staiger, 2021 ; Zhang et al., 2021 ). In our proteomics study, we detected a significant reduction in the abundance of cargo proteins, such as cellulose synthases, but did not detect a statistically significant reduction in the abundance of the exocyst complex subunits. The abundance of SCD complex components and candidate tSNAREs on the plasma membrane was also not affected by ES2 treatment. Previous live-cell imaging data reveal that exocyst subunits are polarized to the outer periclinal face of root epidermal cells ( Zhang et al., 2016 ; Larson et al., 2020 ; Synek et al., 2021 ) and are disrupted by ES2 treatment ( Zhang et al., 2016 ) or genetic disruption of EXO70A1 ( Synek et al., 2021 ), but not by genetic disruption of some SNARE proteins that physically interact with the exocyst complex ( Larson et al., 2020 ). The plasma membrane enrichment reflects the overall abundance of each plasma membrane protein, but not their polarized distribution on a specific face of the plasma membrane. Results from live-cell imaging and our proteomics analyses indicated that ES2 treatment affected the polarized distribution of the exocyst complex in root epidermal cells but did not markedly affect its association with the plasma membrane. The lifetime of exocyst foci on the plasma membrane of root epidermal cells is around 10 s; however, inhibition of exocytosis by a 2-h Brefeldin A (BFA) treatment did not affect membrane localization of the exocyst complex ( Fendrych et al., 2013 ). Thus, exocyst complex association with the plasma membrane may not depend on the other components of the exocytosis machinery. Previous studies demonstrate that exocyst subunits physically interact and associate with the SCD1/2 complex ( Mayers et al., 2017 ), and EXO70 physically interacts with several SNAREs ( Larson et al., 2020 ). Although ES2 disrupts the polarized localization of EXO70A1, our current data do not directly reflect whether ES2 disrupts the physical interaction of exocyst subunits with SCD1/2 complex or SNARE proteins, and/or affects the localization pattern of SCD1/2 and SNAREs. One future direction would be to quantify the localization of fluorescent-tagged SCD1/2 and SNAREs following ES2 treatment. Further, it would be interesting to quantify the association of exocyst subunits with other components of the exocytosis machinery through high spatial-temporal resolution live-cell imaging of double marker lines. Future directions in understanding plant plasma membrane protein dynamics Due to the importance of plant plasma membrane proteins, multiple comparative proteomic studies have been conducted to investigate the profiles of plasma membrane proteins in response to environmental stresses and cell growth status. The composition of plasma membrane proteins changes upon salt stress, cold treatment, osmotic stress, immune signaling, nutrient deficiency and different growth stages of cultured cells ( Nohzadeh Malakshah et al., 2007 ; Nouri and Komatsu, 2010 ; Elmore et al., 2012 ; Li et al., 2012 ; Cao et al., 2016 ; Chen et al., 2016 ; Li et al., 2018 ). These proteomic studies show that the plasma membrane serves as a hub for cells to respond to environmental and growth cues. These studies further indicate that the vesicle trafficking machinery that facilitates the transport of these proteins is essential for plants to respond to biotic and abiotic stresses. Previous findings on the essential functions of plant exocyst complex in plant growth and immune responses ( Synek et al., 2006 ; Fendrych et al., 2010 ; Kulich et al., 2010 ; Kulich et al., 2015 ; Cole et al., 2018 ; Du et al., 2018 ; Guo et al., 2018 ; Žárský, 2022 ) support the hypothesis that the exocyst complex choreographs the dynamic change of specific proteins at the plasma membrane in response to different environmental stimuli and growth cues. In comparison with yeast and mammalian cells, we understand less about the mechanisms of plasma membrane protein delivery and turnover in plants. In this study, using very stringent filtering and cutoff, we found 145 proteins that have significantly (at 10% FDR) reduced abundance at the plasma membrane after a 2-h, 40 μM ES2 treatment, a condition that inhibits but does not completely arrest exocytosis and plant growth. We found that the abundance of some plant plasma membrane proteins was reduced by more than 50%, indicating that the half-time of turnover of these proteins is less than 2 h. We speculate that these proteins undergo fast delivery to the plasma membrane mediated by the exocyst complex and have a rapid turnover at the plasma membrane. There are other proteins that have lower abundance in ES2-treated samples but did not pass the statistical test. We believe these proteins have slower delivery and/or turnover rates at the plasma membrane. It is not well understood how plants control precise delivery of cargo proteins with different dynamics.",Endosidin2 targets conserved exocyst complex subunit EXO70 to inhibit exocytosis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10264680/,

Components of the complex trafficking machinery responsible for polar PIN protein localization have been identified by genetic approaches, but severe developmental phenotypes of trafficking mutants complicate dissection of this pathway. We utilized a temperature sensitive allele of Arabidopsis thaliana SCD1 ( stomatal cytokinesis defective1 ) that encodes a RAB-guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Auxin transport, lateral root initiation, asymmetric auxin-induced gene expression after gravitropic reorientation, and differential gravitropic growth were reduced in the roots of the scd1-1 mutant relative to wild type at the restrictive temperature of 25°C, but not at the permissive temperature of 18°C. In scd1-1 at 25°C, PIN1- and PIN2-GFP accumulated in endomembrane bodies. Transition of seedlings from 18 to 25°C for as little as 20 min resulted in the accumulation of PIN2-GFP in endomembranes, while gravitropism and root developmental defects were not detected until hours after transition to the non-permissive temperature. The endomembrane compartments that accumulated PIN2-GFP in scd1-1 exhibited FM4-64 signal colocalized with ARA7 and ARA6 fluorescent marker proteins, consistent with PIN2 accumulation in the late or multivesicular endosome. These experiments illustrate the power of using a temperature sensitive mutation in the gene encoding SCD1 to study the trafficking of PIN2 between the endosome and the plasma membrane. Using the conditional feature of this mutation, we show that altered trafficking of PIN2 precedes altered auxin transport and defects in gravitropism and lateral root development in this mutant upon transition to the restrictive temperature.",Introduction,Materials and Methods,Results,Discussion,,,"A conditional mutation in SCD1 reveals linkage between PIN protein trafficking, auxin transport, gravitropism, and lateral root initiation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7358545/,

In our study, we used a simulated microgravity device, a 3-D clinostat (Gravite), to investigate whether the LINC complex mediates cellular responses to the simulated microgravity environment. We show that nuclear shape and differential gene expression are both responsive to simulated microgravity in a LINC-dependent manner and that this response changes with the duration of exposure to simulated microgravity.

To study the global LP response, we performed transcription microarrays on Bacillus subtilis cells grown under normal atmospheric pressure (∼101 kPa) and a nearly inhibitory LP (5 kPa), equivalent to the pressure found at an altitude of ∼20 km. Microarray analysis revealed altered levels of 363 transcripts belonging to several global regulons (AbrB, CcpA, CodY, Fur, IolR, ResD, Rok, SigH, Spo0A).

Bacteria are critical to ecosystems, helping recycle nutrients, break down organic matter, and support plant growth. If they struggle to adapt to warmer conditions, the effects could ripple through ecosystems. Our study tested whether Bacillus bacteria, common in soil and water, could adapt to gradual temperature increases. We exposed seven strains from two groups to experimental evolution under increasing warming conditions, expecting them to evolve heat tolerance. Although some bacteria showed small improvements in heat tolerance, neither group could evolve to grow well at temperatures just three degrees Celsius above their natural range. This is concerning, as climate change could raise global temperatures by 2–4 °C, which could push these bacteria beyond their limits. We also found that c-di-AMP, a molecule that helps regulate potassium levels in cells, was involved in temperature tolerance.

To test this notion, Bacillus subtilis cells were cultivated in matched hardware, medium, and environmental conditions either in space flight microgravity on the International Space Station, termed flight (FL) samples, or at Earth-normal gravity, termed ground control (GC) samples. The susceptibility of FL and GC samples was compared to 72 antibiotics and growth-inhibitory compounds using the Omnilog phenotype microarray (PM) system. Only 9 compounds were identified by PM screening as exhibiting significant differences ( P < 0.05, Student's t test) in FL versus GC samples: 6-mercaptopurine, cesium chloride, enoxacin, lomefloxacin, manganese(II) chloride, nalidixic acid, penimepicycline, rolitetracycline, and trifluoperazine. Testing of the same compounds by standard broth dilution assay did not reveal statistically significant differences in the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 s) between FL and GC samples. The results indicate that the susceptibility of B. subtilis cells to a wide range of antibiotics and growth inhibitors is not dramatically altered by space flight.

In Bacillus subtilis , mutations in the rpoB gene encoding the β-subunit of RNAP have been shown to alter a number of global phenotypes, including growth, utilization of unusual nutrient sources, sporulation, germination, and production of secondary metabolites. In addition, the spectrum of mutations in rpoB leading to rifampin resistance (Rif r ) can change dramatically depending upon the environment to which B. subtilis cells or spores are exposed. Rif r rpoB mutations have historically been associated with slower growth and reduced fitness; however, these assessments of fitness were conducted on limited collections of mutants in rich laboratory media that poorly reflect natural environments typically inhabited by B. subtilis . Using a novel deep-sequencing approach in addition to traditional measurements of growth rate, lag time, and pairwise competitions, we demonstrated that the competitive advantages of specific rpoB alleles differ depending on the growth environment in which they are determined. IMPORTANCE Microbial resistance to antibiotics is a growing threat to public health across the world. Historically, resistance to antibiotics has been associated with reduced fitness. A growing body of evidence indicates that resistance to rifampin, a frontline antibiotic used to treat mycobacterial and biofilm-associated infections, may increase fitness given an appropriate environment even in the absence of the selective antibiotic. Here, we experimentally confirm this phenomenon by directly comparing the fitness of multiple rifampin-resistant mutants of Bacillus subtilis in rich LB medium and an asparagine minimal medium. Our research demonstrates that the fitness cost of rifampin resistance can vary greatly depending upon the environment. This has important implications for understanding how microbes develop antimicrobial resistance in the absence of antibiotic selection.",,,,,,,Environmental dependence of competitive fitness in rifampin-resistant rpoB mutants of Bacillus subtilis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8904044/,

However, little is known about the role of SPI-1 in mediating gastrointestinal disease in humans. Recently, SPI-1 deficient nontyphoidal Salmonella strains were isolated from infected humans and animals, indicating that SPI-1 is not required to cause enteropathogenesis and demonstrating the need for more in vivo- like models. Here, we utilized a previously characterized 3-D organotypic model of human intestinal epithelium to elucidate the role of all characterized Salmonella enterica T3SSs. Similar to in vivo reports, the Salmonella SPI-1 T3SS was not required to invade 3-D intestinal cells. Additionally, Salmonella strains carrying single (SPI-1 or SPI-2), double (SPI-1/2) and complete T3SS knockout (SPI-1/SPI-2: flhDC ) also invaded 3-D intestinal cells to wildtype levels. Invasion of wildtype and TTSS mutants was a Salmonella active process, whereas non-invasive bacterial strains, bacterial size beads, and heat-killed Salmonella did not invade 3-D cells. Wildtype and T3SS mutants did not preferentially target different cell types identified within the 3-D intestinal aggregates, including M-cells/M-like cells, enterocytes, or Paneth cells. Moreover, each T3SS was necessary for substantial intracellular bacterial replication within 3-D cells. Collectively, these results indicate that T3SSs are dispensable for Salmonella invasion into highly differentiated 3-D models of human intestinal epithelial cells, but are required for intracellular bacterial growth, paralleling in vivo infection observations and demonstrating the utility of these models in predicting in vivo -like pathogenic mechanisms.",Introduction,Materials And Methods,Results,Discussion,"Materials And Methods Mammalian Cell Lines and Bacterial Strains Bacterial strains used in this study are described in Table S1 . All bacterial strains were grown in Lennox broth (L broth) as described below [82] .

The cells were cultured in a specialized growth medium comprised of a triple-sugar minimal essential medium α–L-15 base supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, designated as GTSF-2 [85] , and incubated at 37°C at 5% CO 2 environment. Antibodies and Reagents Antibodies against specified antigens were obtained from the following sources: Sialyl Lewis A (MC-551; Kamiya), polyclonal Salmonella O antisera (BD Difco), monoclonal Salmonella antibody (MAI-83451; Affinity Bioreagents), syndecan-1 (MCA681T; AbD seroTec), Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) (ab58375; Abcam), ITF goblet cell marker (15C6; Santa Cruz), and Alexa Fluor 633 phalloidin (A22284; Invitrogen). Fluoresbrite plain YG 2.00 micron microspheres (fluorescent beads) were obtained from Polysciences, Inc. (18338). For mammalian cell viability, 0.4% trypan blue (Sigma) was used at a 1∶1 ratio with cells suspended in cell culture media. Growth of 3-D intestinal cells in the RWV The development of 3-D intestinal tissue models was performed as previously described [31] , [32] . In brief, HT-29 epithelial cells were initially grown as monolayers in tissue culture flasks, trypsinized, and resuspended in fresh medium at a density of 2×10 6 cells/ml. Cells were then introduced into RWV bioreactors (Synthecon, Inc.) together with collagen-coated Cytodex-3 microcarrier beads (Pharmacia), resulting in a final ratio of ∼10 cells/bead [85] . Cells were cultured in the RWV bioreactors in GTSF-2 at 37°C and 5% CO 2 with rotation at 20 rpm. Fresh medium was replenished after 5 days and then every 24 hours thereafter until harvest of the cultures at 18-23 days. Bacterial invasion and intracellular growth assays HT-29 monolayers were grown in GTSF-2 medium in a 24-well plate at a concentration of ∼1.2 million cells/plate. For 3-D aggregates, cells were harvested from the bioreactor and seeded into 24 well plates at a concentration of ∼19 million cells/plate. For infections, all bacterial strains were grown shaking overnight in L broth medium at 37°C. Bacteria were back-diluted 1∶200 and grown with aeration until the bacterial growth reached OD 600 of ∼0.8. Bacteria were washed twice with Dulbecco's PBS (D-PBS) and used to infect mammalian cells at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10 for 1 h, whereupon infected cells were washed three times with D-PBS and incubated in medium containing 100 µg/ml gentamicin for 3 hour. The cells were then washed three times with D-PBS and fresh medium containing 7.5 µg/ml gentamicin was added. At indicated times post-infection (p.i.), media was removed, cells were washed with PBS, lysed with 500 µl of 0.1% Triton-X 100, and a fraction of the lysate was plated on L agar to enumerate colony-forming units (CFU). For heat killed Salmonella studies, bacteria were taken from the back diluted Salmonella cultures, washed 3 times with D-PBS, resuspended in D-PBS, heated at 90°C for 30 minutes, and used to infect mammalian cells as with live Salmonella . Confocal Microscopy The 3-D aggregates were harvested from the bioreactor and seeded in a 24 well plate at a concentration of approximately 19 million cells/plate. Infections were done either using same protocol as invasion/intracellular growth assays described above, or an established protocol described by Mortimer et al. , which allows for a shorter and synchronized infection [56] . In brief, Salmonella overnight cultures grown in LB shaking at 37°C were back diluted 1∶200 in LB and grown shaking until they reached an OD of ∼1.2. Bacteria were washed 2 times in D-PBS and used to infect mammalian cells at an m.o.i. of 10 for 5 minutes, whereupon host cells washed 3 times and media was replaced with media containing 100 µg/ml gentamicin. At indicated times p.i., 3-D aggregates were fixed in 4.0% paraformaldehyde in D-PBS for 30 minutes at room temperature. For staining, cells were washed three times with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and blocked for 1 hour with blocking buffer (D-PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% BSA). Blocking buffer with primary antibody (concentration antibody dependent) was added to the cells for 1 hour at 37°C. Cells were then rinsed three times with D-PBS and incubated for 1 hour with secondary antibody diluted 1∶1000 in blocking buffer. Aggregates were rinsed with D-PBS and mounted with Pro-Long Gold Anti-fade with DAPI (Invitrogen). Samples were analyzed with the Carl Zeiss 510 Inverted confocal microscope using a 100× objective and ZEN Light Edition 2009 software.

The HPV life cycle is differentiation-dependent, requiring tissue culture methodology able to recapitulate the three-dimensional (3D) stratified epithelium. Here we report two distinct and complementary methods to grow differentiating epithelial tissues that mimic many critical morphological and biochemical aspects of in vivo tissue. The first approach involves growing primary human epithelial cells on top of a dermal equivalent consisting of collagen fibers and living fibroblast cells. When these cells are grown at the liquid-air interface, differentiation occurs and allows for epithelial stratification. The second approach uses a rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor. The low-fluid-shear microgravity environment inside the bioreactor allows the cells to use collagen-coated microbeads as a growth scaffold and self assemble into 3D cellular aggregates. These approaches are applied to epithelial cells derived from HPV-positive and -negative oral and cervical tissues. The second part of the protocol introduces potential downstream applications for these 3D tissue models.

By using rotating-wall vessel bioreactors to create a physiologically relevant, low-fluid-shear environment, S. aureus was evaluated for cellular responses that could impact its colonization and virulence. S. aureus cells grown in a low-fluid-shear environment initiated a novel attachment-independent biofilm phenotype and were completely encased in extracellular polymeric substances. Compared to controls, low-shear-cultured cells displayed slower growth and repressed virulence characteristics, including decreased carotenoid production, increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, and reduced survival in whole blood. Transcriptional whole-genome microarray profiling suggested alterations in metabolic pathways. Further genetic expression analysis revealed downregulation of the RNA chaperone Hfq, which parallels low-fluid-shear responses of certain Gram-negative organisms. This is the first study to report an Hfq association with fluid shear in a Gram-positive organism, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved response to fluid shear among structurally diverse prokaryotes. Collectively, our results suggest S. aureus responds to a low-fluid-shear environment by initiating a biofilm/colonization phenotype with diminished virulence characteristics, which could lead to insight into key factors influencing the divergence between infection and colonization during the initial host-pathogen interaction.",,,,,,,Induction of attachment-independent biofilm formation and repression of Hfq expression by low-fluid-shear culture of Staphylococcus aureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3187170/,

Hypothesized and confirmed links between amphibian declines, disease, and environmental changes are increasingly represented in published literature. However, there are few long-term amphibian studies that include data on population size, abnormality/injury rates, disease, and habitat variables to adequately assess changes through time. We cultured and identified microorganisms isolated from abnormal/injured and repressed tissue regeneration sites of the endangered Ozark Hellbender, Cryptobranchus alleganiensis bishopi , to discover potential causative agents responsible for their significant decline in health and population. This organism and our study site were chosen because the population and habitat of C. a. bishopi have been intensively studied from 1969–2009, and the abnormality/injury rate and apparent lack of regeneration were established. Although many bacterial and fungal isolates recovered were common environmental organisms, several opportunistic pathogens were identified in association with only the injured tissues of C.a. bishopi . Bacterial isolates included Aeromonas hydrophila , a known amphibian pathogen, Granulicetella adiacens , Gordonai terrae , Stenotrophomonas maltophilia , Aerococcus viridans , Streptococcus pneumoniae and a variety of Pseudomonads, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa , P. stutzeri , and P. alcaligenes . Fungal isolates included species in the genera Penicillium , Acremonium , Cladosporium , Curvularia , Fusarium , Streptomycetes , and the Class Hyphomycetes. Many of the opportunistic pathogens identified are known to form biofilms. Lack of isolation of the same organism from all wounds suggests that the etiological agent responsible for the damage to C. a. bishopi may not be a single organism. To our knowledge, this is the first study to profile the external microbial consortia cultured from a Cryptobranchid salamander.

The NFWR currently supports only a very small population of C. a. bishopi , of which about 50% within the original NFWR research section of Nickerson and Mays [36] , [37] have substantial abnormalities/injuries (J. Briggler unpublished data). On 17 August 2007, we methodically searched a portion of the NFWR by snorkeling and lifting rocks. We located and captured six adult hellbenders, all with abnormalities/injuries ( Table 6 ). Each individual hellbender was placed into a clean bucket filled with river water and then measured, weighed, and individually photographed. All C. a. bishopi were visually inspected for the presence of leeches, injuries, or abnormalities. The feet/limbs showing signs of infection (e.g., lesions, sores or exposed bone) were swabbed with sterile, buffered swabs. In addition, the lower lip of one individual with a raw sore was swabbed ( Figure 2 ). Swabs were then streaked onto three different microbiological culture media: sheep's blood agar (SBA), a general all purpose growth medium that supports the culture of a large number of microorganisms and also indicates hemolytic activity; Mannitol Salt Agar (MSA), primarily selective for halo-tolerant bacteria such as staphylococci; and Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDX), primarily selective for fungi ( Figure 1 ). Given the very small population of C. a. bishopi currently existing in the NFWR and given that no animals without abnormality/injury were captured throughout the duration of this study, two feet showing no signs of infection from two C. a. bishopi were swabbed in the same manner and served as uninfected controls. The swabs were streaked onto the different agar plates, and sample plate lids were immediately added and secured with tape. Secured plates were immediately placed into styrofoam coolers with ice packs and transported by vehicle to St. Louis, MO, and flown to the Microbiology Laboratory at the NASA Johnson Space Center (Houston, TX) for microbial identification. Bacterial and fungal isolates were enumerated and then sub-cultured on the medium from the parent culture at room temperature. Bacterial isolates were identified using biochemical analysis with the Vitek 2 system (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Bacterial isolates that could not be identified by the Vitek 2 system were identified by 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing using a MicroSeq 500 16S rDNA Bacterial Identification Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

Furthermore, this research field allows the unveiling of novel connections between low-fluid-shear regions encountered by pathogens during their natural infection process and bacterial virulence. This study is the first to characterize the spaceflight-induced global transcriptional and proteomic responses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa , an opportunistic pathogen that is present in the space habitat. P. aeruginosa responded to spaceflight conditions through differential regulation of 167 genes and 28 proteins, with Hfq as a global transcriptional regulator. Since Hfq was also differentially regulated in spaceflight-grown Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Hfq represents the first spaceflight-induced regulator acting across bacterial species. The major P. aeruginosa virulence-related genes induced in spaceflight were the lecA and lecB lectin genes and the gene for rhamnosyltransferase ( rhlA ), which is involved in rhamnolipid production. The transcriptional response of spaceflight-grown P. aeruginosa was compared with our previous data for this organism grown in microgravity analogue conditions using the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor. Interesting similarities were observed, including, among others, similarities with regard to Hfq regulation and oxygen metabolism. While RWV-grown P. aeruginosa mainly induced genes involved in microaerophilic metabolism, P. aeruginosa cultured in spaceflight presumably adopted an anaerobic mode of growth, in which denitrification was most prominent. Whether the observed changes in pathogenesis-related gene expression in response to spaceflight culture could lead to an alteration of virulence in P. aeruginosa remains to be determined and will be important for infectious disease risk assessment and prevention, both during spaceflight missions and for the general public.",,,,,,,Transcriptional and proteomic responses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to spaceflight conditions involve Hfq regulation and reveal a role for oxygen.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3067220/,

Sub-optimal hydration is associated with key risk factors for COVID-19 mortality, including older age, male sex, race-ethnicity and chronic disease. Chronic hypertonicity, total body water deficit and/or hypovolemia cause multiple intracellular and/or physiologic adaptations that preferentially retain body water and favor positive total body water balance when challenged by infection. Via effects on serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) signaling, aldosterone, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), aquaporin 5 (AQP5) and/or Na + /K + -ATPase, chronic sub-optimal hydration in the weeks before exposure to COVID-19 may conceivably result in: greater abundance of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in the lung, which increases likelihood of COVID-19 infection, lung epithelial cells which are pre-set for exaggerated immune response, increased capacity for capillary leakage of fluid into the airway space, and/or reduced capacity for both passive and active transport of fluid out of the airways. The hypothesized hydration effects suggest hypotheses regarding strategies for COVID-19 risk reduction, such as public health recommendations to increase intake of drinking water, hydration screening alongside COVID-19 testing, and treatment tailored to the pre-infection hydration condition. Hydration may link risk factors and pathways in a unified mechanism for COVID-19 mortality.

C. albicans has been shown to bloom in the GI tract of individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and can promote and increase the severity of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). However, the effects of C. albicans blooms on the host in the context of AUD or AUD-related phenotypes, such as ethanol preference, have been unstudied. In this work, we report a reduction in ethanol consumption and preference in mice colonized with C. albicans . C. albicans -colonized mice exhibited elevated levels of serum PGE 2 and reduced ethanol preference was reversed by injection with antagonists of PGE 2 receptors. Further, injection of mice with a PGE 2 derivative decreased their ethanol preference. These results show that PGE 2 acting on its receptors EP1 and EP2 drives reduced ethanol preference in C. albicans -colonized mice. We also showed altered transcription of dopamine receptors in the dorsal striatum of C. albicans -colonized mice and more rapid acquisition of ethanol conditioned taste aversion, suggesting alterations to reinforcement or aversion learning. Finally, C. albicans -colonized mice were more susceptible to ethanol-induced motor coordination impairment showing significant alterations to the behavioral effects of ethanol. This study identifies a member of the fungal microbiome that alters ethanol preference and demonstrates a role for PGE 2 signaling in these phenotypes.",Introduction,Materials and Methods,Results,Discussion,,,Rapid phenotypic response of LSMMG-'primed' Candida albicans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11888247/,

Microarray analysis revealed that C. albicans subjected to short-term spaceflight culture differentially regulated 452 genes compared to synchronous ground controls, which represented 8.3% of the analyzed ORFs. Spaceflight-cultured C. albicans –induced genes involved in cell aggregation (similar to flocculation), which was validated by microscopic and flow cytometry analysis. We also observed enhanced random budding of spaceflight-cultured cells as opposed to bipolar budding patterns for ground samples, in accordance with the gene expression data. Furthermore, genes involved in antifungal agent and stress resistance were differentially regulated in spaceflight, including induction of ABC transporters and members of the major facilitator family, downregulation of ergosterol-encoding genes, and upregulation of genes involved in oxidative stress resistance. Finally, downregulation of genes involved in actin cytoskeleton was observed. Interestingly, the transcriptional regulator Cap1 and over 30% of the Cap1 regulon was differentially expressed in spaceflight-cultured C. albicans . A potential role for Cap1 in the spaceflight response of C. albicans is suggested, as this regulator is involved in random budding, cell aggregation, and oxidative stress resistance; all related to observed spaceflight-associated changes of C. albicans . While culture of C. albicans in microgravity potentiates a global change in gene expression that could induce a virulence-related phenotype, no increased virulence in a murine intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection model was observed under the conditions of this study. Collectively, our data represent an important basis for the assessment of the risk that commensal flora could play during human spaceflight missions. Furthermore, since the low fluid-shear environment of microgravity is relevant to physical forces encountered by pathogens during the infection process, insights gained from this study could identify novel infectious disease mechanisms, with downstream benefits for the general public.",Introduction,,Results,Discussion,"Discussion The presence of the opportunistic fungus C. albicans in the normal flora of astronauts could present an infectious disease risk during long-term missions. Indeed, microorganisms have been shown to enhance their virulence and/or display virulence-related phenotypes in response to culture in the low fluid-shear environment of both microgravity and microgravity-analogue culture systems [10] – [12] , [20] – [22] , [24] , [34] , [35] , [73] – [79] . Moreover, as C. albicans causes a variety of mucosal and deep tissue infections in immunosuppressed patients [9] , the decreased immune response of astronauts in-flight could further contribute to an increased susceptibility to microbial infections [1] . In addition to the application of spaceflight microbiology studies for infectious disease risk assessment in the astronaut population, these studies also entail applications to advance human health on Earth. Complementing conventional infectious disease research with spaceflight studies can serve to bridge gaps in our current understanding of host-pathogen interactions, given the unique ways in which both the host and pathogen respond to this extreme environment [1] , [2] , [24] . The low fluid-shear forces to which microorganisms are exposed during liquid culture in spaceflight and spaceflight analogues is relevant to environmental conditions encountered during their normal terrestrial lifecycles, including in the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urogenital tracts of the host [3] , [42] – [45] . Thus, studying the responses of microbial cells to the microgravity environment of spaceflight holds potential for the discovery of novel infectious disease mechanisms that cannot be observed using conventional culture conditions, where the force of gravity can mask key cellular responses. This study demonstrated that spaceflight culturing induced a self-aggregative phenotype (resembling the flocculation phenotype of S. cerevisiae ) in C. albicans and altered a plethora of genes involved in stress and drug resistance; which is important for the virulence of this organism. The high prevalence of differentially expressed genes involved in biofilm formation and filamentation of C. albicans in response to spaceflight culture suggests that the microscopically observed self-aggregative phenotype could be reflective of biofilms. Indeed, transcriptional regulation of biofilm formation and filamentation is intertwined in C. albicans , and an increased flocculation phenotype is believed to be the result of hyphae-specific gene expression [80] . C. albicans biofilm formation is divided into four distinct phases: (i) surface adhesion and colonization by yeast-form, spherical cells, (ii) microcolony formation on the attached surface by yeast-form cells, (iii) growth of pseudohyphae and hyphae in concert with synthesis of extracellular matrix, and (iv) dispersal of yeast-form cells to initiate biofilm formation off-site [53] , . Microcolony formation on abiotic surfaces (structurally similar to flocculation) is estimated to take place 3–4 hours after initial adhesion, while formation of pseudohyphae and hyphae occurs at later time points (12–30 hours) [54] . We hypothesize that at the 25-hour time point of fixation in this study (for gene expression/microscopic analysis), C. albicans may have been in the process of transitioning to the hyphal biofilm stage, which was not yet translated at the phenotypic level. In support of this hypothesis is the previous finding that C. albicans grown in LSMMG conditions exerted increased biofilm formation and biofilm-associated filamentation after long-term culture in the RWV bioreactor (4–5 days) [35] . In microgravity-analogue conditions, biofilm formation was observed on the gas-permeable siliconized rubber membranes of RWV bioreactors, while in spaceflight samples, self-aggregation of microbial cells was observed. Interestingly, flocculation of S. cerevisiae has also been reported in LSMMG conditions, but detailed analysis of gene expression was not performed [32] . Furthermore, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus grown in LSMMG also displayed self-aggregative biofilm phenotypes [20] , [73] , and S. Typhimurium formed biofilms during spaceflight culture [11] . For C. albicans , key regulators of filamentation that were differentially regulated by long term culture in LSMMG (i.e., repression of YWP1 , induction of HWP1 and BCR1 ) were not differentially expressed in shorter term spaceflight-grown C. albicans ; although the gene encoding the cell surface glycoprotein Als1 showed significant induction in both spaceflight and spaceflight-analogue cultures. Als1 is functionally and structurally similar to the major flocculation protein in S. cerevisiae , Flo11, and is an effector of filamentation, and a mediator of adherence and flocculation [62] . The transcriptional regulation of self-aggregation has extensively been studied in S. cerevisiae given the associated industrial applications of this phenotype. Three main pathways have been proposed to regulate flocculation (via Flo11) in S. cerevisiae : (i) Ras-cAMP, (ii) MAP kinase (MAPK)-dependent filamentous growth, and (iii) main glucose repression pathway [82] . In this regard, genes involved in the three main flocculation regulatory pathways were also found differentially regulated in spaceflight-cultured C. albicans . Therefore, Als1 could be a key mediator in the observed spaceflight-induced self-aggregative phenotype of C. albicans . We also examined the expression of genes involved in the production of biofilm extracellular matrix proteins. While the complete composition and transcriptional regulation of the extracellular matrix of C. albicans biofilms remains to be unveiled, studies have shown the presence of carbohydrates, proteins and nucleic acid components [83] – [85] . A recent study identified three glucan modifying genes that play a role in glucan incorporation in the biofilm matrix [60] , one of which, glucanosyltransferase (Phr1), was significantly upregulated in spaceflight conditions. Another morphological change that was observed for spaceflight cultures of C. albicans was the presence of an increased number of cells with random budding scars as compared to more cells with a bipolar budding pattern for synchronous ground controls. This phenotype was also observed for S. cerevisiae exposed to spaceflight culture conditions [28] – [30] . Polarized cell division is essential for the development of eukaryotes and prokaryotes, and typically takes place at the distal cell poles (180° from the birth site), termed bipolar budding, or at the proximal cell poles (adjacent to the preceding site of cytokinesis), termed axial budding [86] , [87] . Bipolar budding is believed to maximize nutrient exposure of the growing yeast cells [86] , while axial budding facilitates mating and diploid formation [88] . Specific mutations and environmental conditions cause random budding which is associated with loss of cell polarity, as reflected in a round cell morphology and cell separation deficiency, associated with production of cell clumps [87] , [89] . As described above, enhanced cell clumping was observed for spaceflight cultures of C. albicans . In agreement with the random budding phenotype of C. albicans in spaceflight cultures, multiple genes involved in random budding of yeast were significantly affected. Interestingly, the enhanced presence of multiple budding scars could indicate the generation of more daughter cells in spaceflight conditions, which is supported by the smaller cell size of spaceflight-cultured C. albicans , and at the transcriptional level, by the induction of the daughter-cell specific transcription factor ACE2 and downregulation of the G1 cyclin CLN3 in spaceflight-cultured C. albicans (see above) [68] . In yeast, asymmetric cell division results in the generation of smaller daughter cells as compared to the mother cell [90] . Since the regulation of the G1 cycle is, in part, dependent on cell size; daughter cells require additional growth before the Start transition in G1. This process is orchestrated by a cell size-sensing module, in which Cln3 is the main regulator [91] . The daughter-cell specific transcription factor, Ace2, has a direct negative regulatory effect on the expression of CLN3 , which plays a role in delaying the G1 phase in daughter cells [69] . The enhanced presence of daughter cells could also indicate differential growth rate of C. albicans in spaceflight conditions. While at the time point of analysis, no differences in viable cell counts were recorded, more detailed monitoring of growth profiles are needed to determine if C. albicans altered its generation time in flight. It was hypothesized by Walther et al . that the random budding pattern in spaceflight cultures of S. cerevisiae could be explained by microgravity-induced changes in the cytoskeleton, which has been reported for a variety of mammalian cells (reviewed in [70] ). Indeed, the actin cytoskeleton is essential for bud site selection, and mutants in actin organization exert a random budding phenotype [67] . In accordance with Walther and colleagues, we found that C. albicans exposed to spaceflight culture conditions downregulated several key genes involved in the actin organization and polymerization. Several mechanisms of drug resistance have been described for C. albicans yeast cells, including differential expression of drug targets, efflux pump-mediated drug transport, and utilization of compensatory and catabolic pathways [64] , [95] . Biofilm formation confers additional resistance in C. albicans through increased cell density, production of extracellular matrix proteins, and the presence of persisters [64] , [96] . In this study, genes encoding ABC transporters and multidrug efflux proteins (major facilitator family) were induced in spaceflight-cultured C. albicans (such as CDR1 , CDR4, CDR12 ), which are involved in resistance to different classes of antifungals including polyenes (e.g. amphotericin B) and azoles. Also, spaceflight cultures of C. albicans showed downregulation of genes encoding ergosterol ( ERG6 , ERG25 ), which is a major drug target for this organism. Ergosterol is uniquely present in the membranes of yeast and fungal cells, and polyenes specifically target ergosterol in the fungal membrane, which creates pores and results in cell death [95] . Downregulation of ergosterol levels in the cell membrane of sessile or biofilm-forming C. albicans contributes to the resistance of this organism to both polyene and azole antifungal agents. Interestingly, enhanced resistance of LSMMG-cultured C. albicans to amphotericin B was previously observed, which increased with the time of incubation under these microgravity-analogue conditions [35] . In addition, S. Typhimurium showed induction of outer membrane porins, ABC transporters, and other genes involved in antibiotic resistance in response to culture in spaceflight conditions [11] . Whether the observed differences in gene expression translate to a phenotype of C. albicans that is more resistant to antifungal drug agents remains to be determined. We observed that a significant number of genes differentially regulated in response to spaceflight culture were involved in the oxidative stress resistance of C. albicans . Cap1 presumably played a role in the oxidative stress-associated gene expression since it has been shown to be involved in the oxidative stress response of C. albicans [63] , and more than 30% of the Cap1 regulon was affected by spaceflight. It would seem unlikely that increased gene expression related to oxidative stress resistance is due to the presence of increased oxygen levels since previously reported gene expression profiles of bacterial FPA cultures exposed to spaceflight indicated responses to microaerophilic/anaerobic conditions, presumably due to low fluid-shear levels and/or limited mixing in microgravity [10] , [11] , [79] . In correspondence with our data, the spaceflight-induced proteome of S. cerevisiae comprised multiple proteins involved in oxidative stress [30] . Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that growth of S. cerevisiae in spaceflight in hyperoxic conditions resulted in extracellular release of glutathione [29] . The observed increase in glutathione release was suggested to have occurred through activation of ion channels in response to cytoskeletal rearrangements in microgravity culture conditions [29] . Spaceflight has been shown to modulate oxidative functions in other eukaryotic cell types, animal models, and astronauts [29] , [97] – [102] . Collectively, our data indicate a potentially increased resistance of spaceflight-cultured C. albicans to antimicrobial agents and environmental stressors as compared to ground controls, which would need to be confirmed at the phenotypic level during future studies. Despite the induction of a virulence-related phenotype of C. albicans in spaceflight conditions, we did not observe significant differences in virulence, as determined using an i.p. mouse model of infection. This observation could potentially be explained by the route of infection, the use of only a single lethal dose of C. albicans for the inoculation, and the short-term exposure to spaceflight. Indeed, i.p. infection is not a standard infection method for C. albicans , and was chosen given the unique time constraints associated with the spaceflight experiment. Alternatively, it is possible that spaceflight culture does not impact the virulence of C. albicans . Additional studies are needed to conclusively determine if spaceflight alters C. albicans virulence. Since the RNA-binding protein, Hfq, was previously identified as a major regulator of the microgravity and/or microgravity-analogue response of S. Typhimurium, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus [21] , we investigated the influence of spaceflight on expression of the LSm family of RNA-binding proteins in C. albicans , which are evolutionarily conserved eukaryotic homologues of Hfq [103] . The gene encoding the LSm2 protein was the only LSm family member that was significantly affected by spaceflight culture of C. albicans under the conditions of this study. LSm2 is part of (i) the cytoplasmic LSm1-7 complex, which is important for mRNA decapping and decay, and (ii) the nuclear LSm2-8 complex, which is important for pre-mRNA and pre-rRNA processing [104] – [107] . In response to stress, there is a rapid shift of LSm proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where the LSm1-7 complex concentrates within granular foci called processing bodies (P-bodies) [104] – [108] . To our knowledge, the role of LSm2 in the transcriptional regulation, virulence and behavior of C. albicans is unknown. Whether LSm2 regulation is involved in the spaceflight response of C. albicans , supporting a conserved transcriptional regulation between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, needs to be assessed in follow-up studies. In summary, this study is the first to demonstrate that spaceflight culture conditions globally alter the gene expression profile of a eukaryotic pathogen and could potentially induce a virulence-related phenotype, and represents an initial step towards the infectious disease risk assessment of C. albicans during spaceflight missions. The effect of longer-term microgravity cultivation on the biofilm formation, filamentation and virulence phenotype of C. albicans , together with investigation of the potential spaceflight-activated transcriptional regulator Cap1 identified in this study is of interest for future research. Moreover, this study further reinforces the role that physical forces in the human body, such as low fluid-shear, could play in the infection process; insights that hold promise to fundamentally advance our understanding of infectious disease on Earth.","Supporting Information Figure S1 Schematic of fluid processing apparatus (FPA).

C. albicans is a common opportunistic fungal pathogen responsible for a variety of superficial infections as well as systemic and more severe infections in humans. Cumulatively, the propensity of this organism to be widespread through the population, the ability to produce disease in immunocompromised individuals, and the tendency to respond to environmental stress with characteristics associated with increased virulence, require a better understanding of the yeast response to microgravity for spaceflight crew safety. As such, the responses of this yeast cultivated during several missions using two in-flight culture bioreactors were analyzed and compared herein. In general, C. albicans had a slightly shorter generation time and higher growth propensity in microgravity as compared to terrestrial controls. Rates of cell filamentation differed between bioreactors, but were low and not significantly different between flight and terrestrial controls. Viable cells were retrieved and cultured, resulting in a colony morphology that was similar between cells cultivated in flight and in terrestrial control conditions, and in contrast to that previously observed in a ground-based microgravity analog system. Of importance, yeast demonstrated an increased resistance when challenged during spaceflight with the antifungal agent, amphotericin B. Similar levels of resistance were not observed when challenged with the functionally disparate antifungal drug caspofungin.

The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has proven to be an exceptionally powerful model for toxicological studies. Here, we develop novel technologies to describe the effects of cyanide toxicity with high spatiotemporal resolution. Importantly, we use these methods to examine the genetic underpinnings of cyanide resistance. Caenorhabditis elegans that lack the EGL-9 oxygen sensing enzyme have been shown to be resistant to hydrogen cyanide (HCN) gas produced by the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. We demonstrate that the cyanide resistance exhibited by egl-9 mutants is completely dependent on the HIF-1 hypoxia-inducible factor and is mediated by the cysl-2 cysteine synthase, which likely functions in metabolic pathways that inactivate cyanide. Further, the expression of cysl-2 correlates with the degree of cyanide resistance exhibited in each genetic background. We find that each mutant exhibits similar relative resistance to HCN gas on plates or to aqueous potassium cyanide in microfluidic chambers. The design of the microfluidic devices, in combination with real-time imaging, addresses a series of challenges presented by mutant phenotypes and by the chemical nature of the toxicant.

However, hydrated magnesium sulfate mineral levels in the regolith of Mars can reach as high as 10 wt%, and would be expected to be highly inhibitory to plant growth. Methodology and Principal Findings Disabling ion transporters AtMRS2-10 and AtSULTR1;2, which are plasma membrane localized in peripheral root cells, is not an effective way to confer tolerance to magnesium sulfate soils. Arabidopsis mrs2-10 and sel1-10 knockout lines do not mitigate the growth inhibiting impacts of high MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O concentrations observed with wildtype plants. A global approach was used to identify novel genes with potential to enhance tolerance to high MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O (magnesium sulfate) stress. The early Arabidopsis root transcriptome response to elevated concentrations of magnesium sulfate was characterized in Col-0, and also between Col-0 and the mutant line cax1-1 , which was confirmed to be relatively tolerant of high levels of MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O in soil solution. Differentially expressed genes in Col-0 treated for 45 min. encode enzymes primarily involved in hormone metabolism, transcription factors, calcium-binding proteins, kinases, cell wall related proteins and membrane-based transporters. Over 200 genes encoding transporters were differentially expressed in Col-0 up to 180 min. of exposure, and one of the first down-regulated genes was CAX1 . The importance of this early response in wildtype Arabidopsis is exemplified in the fact that only four transcripts were differentially expressed between Col-0 and cax1-1 at 180 min. after initiation of treatment. Conclusions/Significance The results provide a solid basis for the understanding of the metabolic response of plants to elevated magnesium sulfate soils; it is the first transcriptome analysis of plants in this environment. The results foster the development of Mars soil-compatible plants by showing that cax1 mutants exhibit partial tolerance to magnesium sulfate, and by elucidating a small subset (500 vs. >10,000) of candidate genes for mutation or metabolic engineering that will enhance tolerance to magnesium sulfate soils.",Introduction,Materials and Methods,Results,Discussion,"Discussion The use of regolith on Mars with high levels of hydrated sulfate minerals for bioregenerative life support systems will lead to exposure of plant roots to supra-optimal concentrations of both Mg 2+ and SO 4 2− ions in the soil solution. The results in this study show that knockout mutant lines of the known genes in Arabidopsis encoding root plasma membrane based uptake transporters of Mg 2+ and SO 4 2− ions failed to confer an adaptive advantage to a MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O enriched environment. Because sel1-10 mutants are known to take up 80% less sulfate than their wildtype background Ws, these results mean that phytotoxic effects of magnesium sulfate on overall plant growth are dominated by the Mg 2+ cation. Overexpression of AtMRS2-10 ( AtMGT1 ) in Nicotiana benthamiana led to increased accumulation of magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), and iron (Fe) per unit dry weight and per plant compared to wildtype plants [29] . However, the potential role of AtMRS2-10 as a major uptake transporter of Mg 2+ in Arabidopsis remains uncertain based on the observation that mrs2-10 plants did not show a significant difference in leaf Mg levels compared to Col-0 under standard nutrient conditions. This could explain why, despite the indication that Mg dominantly affects overall plant growth, the mrs2-10 mutant did not show a significant improvement in growth performance compared to Col-0. Interestingly, the dominant role of Mg is also supported by the relative tolerance of the cax1-1 vacuolar H + /Ca 2+ transport mutant plants to elevated levels of MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O. The soil data shown in Figures 5 and 6 are in line with the relative tolerance of cax1-1 on agar to high concentrations of dissolved MgCl 2 , a mineral in which the Mg 2+ cation is the dominant phytotoxic factor [16] . In addition, Bradshaw et al (2005) observed that cax1 mutants are better able to tolerate the low Ca∶Mg ratios characteristic of terrestrial serpentine soils. The CAX1 knockout mutation does not fully eliminate the effects of high magnesium sulfate on plant growth performance; the absolute FW shoot biomass of cax1-1 grown on soil for four weeks was still low (20%) compared to untreated Col-0. The primary Arabidopsis Col-0 root transcriptome responses to elevated levels of magnesium sulfate suggest a number of candidate genes that could play a role in enhancing the growth performance of plants exposed to this nutrient stress. Transcriptome responses of Arabidopsis Col-0 roots exposed to MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O versus a control solution for 45 min. revealed over 300 differentially expressed genes. Genes of known functional category include those encoding enzymes involved in hormone metabolism, transcription factors, calcium-binding proteins, kinases, disease resistance proteins, cell wall related proteins, and membrane-based transporters. The biological significance of this seemingly diverse set of gene classes illustrates the comprehensive nature of a primary abiotic stress response. The differentially expressed genes at Time 45 encoding enzymes in the ABA, ethylene and jasmonate biosynthesis pathways point to possible changes in the synthesis of these phytohormones. ABA, ethylene, and jasmonic acid have all been implicated in adaptive mechanisms of osmotic stress, ion-mediated signal transduction and the regulation of transporters [30] , [31] , [32] . The exact role of many of the differentially expressed genes at Time 45 encoding transcription factors is currently unknown, although some are associated with tolerance to other abiotic stresses. The up-regulation at Time 45 of the gene encoding ZAT7 is for example in line with the finding that ZAT7 renders plants more tolerant to salinity stress when constitutively expressed [33] . The down-regulation at Time 45 of the gene encoding WRKY70 correlates with the observation that WRKY70 functions as a negative regulator of developmental senescence and is involved in plant defense signaling pathways [34] . The majority of transcripts encoding kinases that are differentially expressed at Time 45 encode uncharacterized protein kinases as well as receptor-like protein kinases (RLKs) with extracytoplasmic leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) or with an extracellular lectin-like domain. RLKs are membrane-spanning proteins with a predicted signal sequence and a cytoplasmic kinase domain that have been implicated in a wide range of signal transduction pathways [35] . The up-regulated expression of the gene encoding CBL-interacting protein kinase CIPK9 at Time 45 is consonant with the fact that CIPK9 is required for low-potassium tolerance in Arabidopsis [36] . Genes encoding proteins that belong to the transcription factor or kinase categories might be transcriptional or post-translational regulators of transporters [37] . Within the group of genes encoding membrane based transporters, the Ca 2+ /H + antiporter CAX1 is one of the few transporter genes that are already differentially expressed at Time 45. Its down-regulated expression is in line with our finding that the cax1-1 mutant performed better compared to wildtype when grown on soil with elevated levels of magnesium sulfate. The slightly up-regulated expression of the gene encoding magnesium transporter MRS2-10 at Time 90 and 180 agrees with the observation that a knockout mutant of AtMRS2-10 ( mrs2-10 ) does not show improved growth in the form of higher FW shoot biomass compared to Col-0 at elevated levels of magnesium sulfate. MRS2 transporters have been shown to transport other ions in addition to Mg 2+ [29] , [38] . Schock et al. (2002) speculate that, in line with the large number of AtMRS2 family members, the function of the AtMRS2 gene family may be the maintenance of metal ion homeostasis in different cellular compartments (i.e. over different cellular membrane systems). The expression of the gene encoding SULTR1;2, a high-affinity sulfate transporter, showed no significant differences at the three time points. The fact that expression of the gene is not down-regulated in the early adaptation response of Arabidopsis roots to high levels of magnesium sulfate supports the outcome of the FW shoot biomass comparison between the AtSULTR1;2 knockout mutant sel1-10 and Col-0, which showed no advantage for sel1-10 . The gene encoding EIL3, one of the known transcriptional regulators of SULTR1;2 [39] , did not show a significant difference in expression at any of the time points either. Interestingly, two sulfate transporter genes of the same family as SULTR1;2 show down-regulated expression; the gene encoding SULTR3;4 at Time 90 and 180, and the gene encoding SULTR3;1 at Time 180. The spatial and subcellular localization of these transporters is not known, and so far no influence on the expression of Group 3 sulfate transporters by the sulfur status of plants has been reported [40] . This study shows for the first time that genes encoding Group 3 sulfate transporters SULTR3;1 and SULTR3;4 are differentially expressed in roots upon exposure to high levels of sulfate. The expression of the gene encoding another sulfate transporter - the tonoplast-localized H + /SO 4 2− cotransporter SULTR4;1 - is also down-regulated at Time 180, pointing at the possible retention of excess SO 4 2− in the vacuole. Similarly, the up-regulated expression of the gene encoding the vacuolar MHX transporter indicates the possible storage of excess Mg 2+ in the vacuole. Both MHX and SULTR1;4 could be seen as marker genes for excess magnesium sulfate recognition by the plant, since vacuolar storage of excess ions is a well-known defense mechanism against ion stress. Several members of the CAX (cation exchanger) family show down-regulated expression in response to elevated magnesium sulfate. The Ca 2+ /H + antiporter CAX1, which shows down-regulated expression across the time points, is localized to the tonoplast and responsible for 50% of the Ca 2+ /H + antiport activity there [16] . CAX2 has been shown to transport Ca 2+ and Mn 2+ into the vacuole in Arabidopsis and other plant species [41] , and CAX3 is known as a weak Ca 2+ vacuolar transporter. CAX1 and CAX3 can be combined as “hetero-CAX” complexes to form functional transporters with distinct transport properties [42] . The down-regulated expression of the genes encoding these three vacuolar Ca 2+ /H + antiporters indicates a possible shortage of calcium in the cytosol upon high magnesium sulfate exposure. In total, over 200 differentially expressed genes encoding membrane-based transporters were identified across the Col-0 time series. Among the genes encoding transporters of known and unknown function, candidates for improving plant tolerance to high magnesium sulfate may be found. Transporters of unknown function include for example major intrinsic proteins, cyclic nucleotide gated channels, integral membrane proteins, cation efflux family proteins, ATPase E1–E2 type family proteins, MATE efflux family proteins, transporter-related proteins and putative transporters. The differential expression of only four unique transcripts between cax1-1 and Col-0 plants after 180 min. of MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O treatment indicates that the root transcriptome responses are virtually identical for the two genotypes at this time after initiation of treatment. In our transcriptome study we see down-regulation of the gene encoding vacuolar sulfate efflux transporter SULTR4;1 at Time 180, and up-regulation of the gene encoding vacuolar magnesium influx transporter MHX at Time 90 and Time 180 in Col-0 exposed to elevated magnesium sulfate. Both of these responses point to storage of excess magnesium and sulfate ions in the vacuole. This means that the profile is most probably not performed at a time point before plants recognize excess magnesium sulfate, especially since over 3000 differentially expressed genes were detected in Col-0 at Time 180, in addition to the vacuolar marker genes. We could therefore not foresee that after 180 minutes of exposure there were no more than four differentially expressed transcripts between the cax1-1 mutant and Col-0. One of the main reasons for the limited number of differentially regulated transcripts between the genotypes at this time after initiation of treatment may be that CAX1 is one of the few transporter genes that are already differentially expressed after 45 min. of exposure in Col-0, which means that down-regulated expression of CAX1 is an important natural response of Arabidopsis to elevated levels of magnesium sulfate. The response of CAX1 and other CAX family members in the Col-0 time series suggests that a deficiency of calcium caused by high levels of magnesium and possibly by calcium sulfate precipitation could play a major part in the reduction of plant growth performance in the presence of high magnesium sulfate concentrations. The difference between the immediately down-regulated level of CAX1 in Col-0 and the absence of CAX1 in the cax1-1 knockout mutant is apparently not sufficiently large at 180 min. after initiation of treatment to reveal many of the downstream molecular processes eventually leading to enhanced growth performance and reduced leaf Mg content of cax1-1 compared to Col-0 after several weeks of growth. This result is significant in that follow-up studies contrasting cax1-1 with Col-0 can look at profiles after possibly even days of exposure. Conclusions and perspectives It was initially thought that the mrs2-10 and sel1-10 mutants would have an advantage over wildtype in elevated magnesium sulfate soils, but this was not the case. However, fresh weight shoot biomass analyses showed that although mrs2-10 and sel1-10 mutants were not more successful than wildtype in this soil environment, the cax1 mutants were. Thus, cax1 mutants are currently the only confirmed genotype with partial tolerance to the phytotoxic levels of magnesium sulfate expected for the regolith on Mars. To further characterize the response of Arabidopsis to Mars-like levels of magnesium sulfate a set of experiments was conducted to evaluate patterns of gene expression in wildtype (Col-0) and cax1 mutants. The 325 genes differentially expressed in Col-0 roots after 45 min. of exposure to high magnesium sulfate can be seen as candidate genes for enhanced tolerance. This set of genes included CAX1 , 18 genes previously associated with enhanced tolerance to broad ranges of abiotic stresses, and several well-characterized genes known to enhance tolerance to other salts like NaCl. Many of the differentially regulated genes contain promoter sequence motifs that are known to play a role in ABA-mediated regulation, such as ABRE-CE. This abundance suggests that ABA plays a role in regulating the stress response to elevated magnesium sulfate. In addition, a rich pool of candidates is found in the 200+ transporter genes that are differentially expressed in Col-0 across the time points. Many genes in this set encode transporters of unknown function. These unknown transporter genes, along with the four differentially regulated transcripts between cax1-1 and Col-0, are of particular interest as they encode proteins of unknown function whose roles are now at least implicated. This study functions as a solid basis for the development of Mars soil-compatible plants by reducing the number of potential candidate genes from tens of thousands to several hundred. Future research efforts could determine whether any of these candidate genes, or their potential regulators, can be confirmed as genomic loci for (crop) plant growth enhancement in the presence of mars-like levels of magnesium sulfate.","Supporting Information Table S1 Plant growth performance ANOVA.

In particular, the disruption of intestinal homeostasis is closely related to other health problems, and it is necessary to monitor related treatment strategies. Ginseng is a well-known Chinese herbal medicine often used to maintain health. Ginseng total saponins (GTSs), which are the bioactive components of ginseng, have been reported to regulate immune homeostasis, anti-inflammation, and anti-oxidation. This study focused on the regulation of GTSs in intestinal homeostasis imbalance caused by microgravity. Methods A hindlimb suspension (HLS) rat model was established to evaluate the intestinal protective effects of GTSs. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened using RNA-Seq. RT-PCR was performed to further focus and verify these results. The gut microbiome composition was examined based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and the short-chain fatty acids produced were further analyzed. Results We found that GTSs intervention effectively improved the intestinal injury caused by simulated weightlessness, including reducing the pathological damage, increasing the expression of tight junction proteins and reducing the levels of inflammatory factors. Moreover, GTSs treatment significantly restored the levels of intestinal immunity-related genes and remodeled the gut microbiota. In particular, GTSs significantly increased the abundance of short-chain fatty acid metabolism-related bacteria, thereby increasing the level of propionic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid. Conclusion Our results revealed that GTSs improved intestinal microecological disorders and impaired immune function caused by the weightlessness simulation. The underlying mechanism may be related to the “intestinal immune -microbiota-metabolic” pathway.

Combining transcriptomics and proteomics approaches, this research gives insights into the coordination of transcriptome and proteome in Arabidopsis’ molecular and physiological responses to Spaceflight environmental stress. Arabidopsis seedlings were germinated and grown in microgravity (µ g ) aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in NASA Biological Research in Canisters – Light Emitting Diode (BRIC LED) hardware, with the ground control established on Earth. At 10 days old, seedlings were frozen in RNA-later and returned to Earth. RNA-seq transcriptomics and TMT-labeled LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis of cellular fractionates from the plant tissues suggest the alteration of the photosynthetic machinery (PSII and PSI) in spaceflight, with the plant shifting photosystem core-regulatory proteins in an organ-specific manner to adapt to the microgravity environment. An overview of the ribosome, spliceosome, and proteasome activities in spaceflight revealed a significant abundance of transcripts and proteins involved in protease binding, nuclease activities, and mRNA binding in spaceflight, while those involved in tRNA binding, exoribonuclease activity, and RNA helicase activity were less abundant in spaceflight. CELLULOSE SYNTHASES (CESA1, CESA3, CESA5, CESA7) and CELLULOSE-LIKE PROTEINS (CSLE1, CSLG3), involved in cellulose deposition and TUBULIN COFACTOR B (TFCB) had reduced abundance in spaceflight. This contrasts with the increased expression of UDP-ARABINOPYRANOSE MUTASEs, involved in the biosynthesis of cell wall non-cellulosic polysaccharides, in spaceflight. Both transcripts and proteome suggested an altered polar auxin redistribution, lipid, and ionic intracellular transportation in spaceflight. Analyses also suggest an increased metabolic energy requirement for plants in Space than on Earth, hence, the activation of several shunt metabolic pathways. This study provides novel insights, based on integrated RNA and protein data, on how plants adapt to the spaceflight environment and it is a step further at achieving sustainable crop production in Space.",Introduction,Materials and methods,Results,Discussion,"4 Discussion 4.1 Arabidopsis adapts photosystems to the spaceflight environment to minimize impacts on photosynthesis This study assesses the physiological and molecular impacts of the spaceflight environment on Arabidopsis seedlings grown in NASA BRIC LED hardware using a combined transcriptomics and proteomics approach. The BRIC LED hardware, with integrated LED illumination, provides the growing seedlings with a source of light. Hence, plants growing in the BRIC LED hardware on ISS will have light cues but lack gravitational cues. This enabled us to study the effects of microgravity on plant transcriptome and organ-specific proteome, while also providing insight into how the plant root and shoot individually integrate light signaling in the absence of gravity. Evidence from this study suggests that the operations of the photosynthetic machinery (PSII and PSI) were greatly impacted in spaceflight ( Figure 4 ), with the plant shifting photosystem core-regulatory proteins in an organ-specific manner to adapt to the microgravity environment. While the net photosynthetic rate might not be affected in microgravity as it was not captured in this study, the molecular functions of the photosynthetic apparatus, as revealed by this study, were impacted. The abundance of the NusG-like proteins (PTAC12, PTAC14, PTAC3, PTAC4) in the shoot and NusG-like proteins (PTAC16, PTAC14) in the root ( Supplementary Table D ) suggests attempts at boosting the translational efficiency of chloroplast ribosomes to reduce the plant sensitivity to environmental stress in spaceflight. The abundance of D1 complex protein (PSBA) and the PPL1 in spaceflight suggests attempts to optimize the water-oxidizing reaction and repair damages to the PSII. Reduced abundance of the PSAB and PSAE isoforms of the PSI in spaceflight, signifies an increased susceptibility of the PSII to photoinhibition ( Krieger-Liszkay et al., 2020 ; Ji et al., 2022 ) and a deficiency of the PSI steady state redox-level and re-oxidation. The PPL1, which was abundant in spaceflight in both organs, works to facilitate the assembly of PSII and optimize plant fitness under increased sensitivity to the BRIC LED hardware light. Suppression of the PSI electron transport subunit protein, PETH, in spaceflight, is associated with reduced efficiency of the electron transport chain and instability of the PSI. However, this reduced efficiency is compensated for by an increased abundance of chloroplast gene translations (PTACs), which helps to prevent over-reduction of the plastoquinone pool. The reduced abundance of PSII proximal antennae protein cp43 (PSBC) and the light-harvesting chlorophyll complexes (LHCB1, LHCB4, LHCB5, LHCB6) in spaceflight suggest an attempt to decrease light harvest by the photosystems, hence decrease photoinhibition, increase the oxygen-evolving capability and improve repair to PSII. Varying degrees of molecular perturbations to the plant photosystem complexes in spaceflight have earlier been reported, which further validate our findings ( Stutte et al., 2005 ; Chen and Wang, 2016 ; Vandenbrink et al., 2019 ). However, unlike in this current study, where PSII and PSI complexes transcripts (RNA) were upregulated in spaceflight, Vandenbrink et al. (2019) reported significant downregulation of transcripts enriched in photosynthetic pathways in spaceflight compared to ground samples. They also indicated the downregulation of four RNA transcripts associated with photosynthetic electron transport (petE: plastocyanin, petF: ferredoxin, petH: ferredoxin–NADP+ reductase, petJ: cytochrome c6). These transcripts were however upregulated in spaceflight in our current study, but they were all downregulated at the proteome level in both the plant root and shoot ( Figure 4 ). These discrepancies at the transcript level may be due to the difference in Arabidopsis wildtype ecotypes and spaceflight hardware utilized in both experiments. While Vandenbrink et al. (2019) utilized the Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Landsberg and the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) hardware, this study utilized the Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia-0 and the BRIC LED hardware. Basu et al. (2017) and Olanrewaju et al. (2023) emphasize that the choice of hardware is a significant source of variations in the results of plant spaceflight experiments transcriptomics and proteomics. Chen and Wang (2016) delineated another tangent by revealing that out of 38 photosystem-associated proteins that exhibited differential expression in spaceflight-grown rice seedlings, 34 were downregulated in spaceflight compared to Earth controls. While our findings and that of Vandenbrink et al. (2019) support the coherent perturbation of both the PSII and PS I as revealed by the transcriptome and proteome, Chen and Wang (2016) suggested from their fluorescent emission spectra studies that despite the changes to the PSII proteins in spaceflight, their activity under microgravity is not affected, in contrast with the PSI which had significantly reduced energy transfer rates, hence impaired photosynthetic activity. Of course, Chen and Wang (2016) study was carried out on Rice seedlings, not Arabidopsis and directly extrapolating the differential PS I and PSII findings to Arabidopsis might not be so efficient. However, a consensus is that the spaceflight environment leads to a reduction in the PS I and PSII complexes, which may be accompanied by reduced photosynthetic efficiency and consequent smaller plant tissues. The expression of the photosynthesis-associated proteins in the root might be due to the architecture of the BRIC LED hardware, which places the LEDs in close proximity to the roots, making them prone to direct hit by light. Interestingly, Paul et al. (2013) also reported the expression of several genes involved in light regulation in Arabidopsis roots in spaceflight transcriptomics experiments, even when the roots were not in close proximity to light. This phenomenon was also observed by Kruse et al. (2020) in their whole seedling transcriptomics study, despite that the seedlings were grown in the total absence of light cue in spaceflight. Hence, it is suggested that when gravity is absent, plant roots rely more heavily on negative phototropism for navigation, inducing light-sensing “tools” in roots in the spaceflight environment ( Paul et al., 2017 ). The proteome landscape of the root and shoot, however, differs significantly in spaceflight, suggesting different adaptation mechanisms to the space environment, a further confirmation of Paul et al. (2013) transcriptomic study’s observation of organ-specificity in plant response to spaceflight. Vandenbrink et al. (2016) also proposed an interaction between plants’ gravity and light harvesting machinery at a genetic level, based on their observations of blue-light phototropic response in roots of Arabidopsis grown in microgravity. The upregulation of most of the photosystem and contrasting decreased abundance of corresponding proteins in spaceflight ( Figure 4 ) however, suggests that major adaptive response to spaceflight environmental stimulus might be regulated at the post-transcriptional level, even though the direct effect of the stimulus is still observed at the transcriptional level. A combined translatome-proteome study approach will be useful to elucidate this phenomenon. 4.2 Intracellular trafficking and cell wall synthesis in spaceflight Plants, throughout their evolutionary history, have developed remarkable adaptations to counteract the unrelenting force of gravity ( Medina et al., 2021 ). To withstand the gravitational force, plants have to ensure a balance between the internal turgor pressure, mediated by intracellular trafficking, and tensile resistance of both the primary and secondary cell walls. One pivotal molecular insight is the potential shift in cellulose metabolism in spaceflight, as indicated by the heightened abundance of Endoglucanase 20. Enhanced cellulose degradation might be a strategic adaptation, possibly optimizing cell wall flexibility in response to the unique stresses of a microgravity environment. This could be complemented by shifts in cellular adhesion dynamics, given the altered levels of FASCICLIN-LIKE ARABINOGALACTAN PROTEINs. The implications of these shifts could range from altered tissue integrity to modifications in intercellular communication. In a comprehensive transcriptomics meta-analysis of Arabidopsis plants cultivated in spaceflight within the BRIC Petri-dish fixation unit (PDFU) hardware, Johnson et al. (2017) highlighted potential alterations in the cell wall matrix of plants in spaceflight, as revealed by the glycomics evaluation of the BRIC-16-Cyt samples. They implied that microgravity influences the biosynthesis of xylan and pectic elements, leading to variations in the composition of the cell wall matrix. Alongside this, Johnson et al. (2017) also reported the reduced abundance of xylan and pectic epitopes in spaceflight-grown plants, which resonate with our findings, highlighting the potential changes in the biosynthesis of cell wall non-cellulosic polysaccharides in spaceflight conditions, particularly in the root. Nakashima et al. (2023) in their novel glycome profiling and immunohistochemistry of Arabidopsis in spaceflight also observed that roots from spaceflight Arabidopsis seedlings displayed a generally increased labeling intensity when targeted with xyloglucan monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) compared to ground controls. They concluded that the heightened fluorescence intensity post-labeling with xyloglucan mAbs might result from changes in polysaccharide biosynthesis and secretion due to microgravity conditions. Wakabayashi et al. (2020) in their studies on Rice seedling cell wall under spaceflight conditions indicated that microgravity reduces the 1,3:1,4-β-glucan content in rice shoot cell walls, implicating an increase in the expression of an endo-1,3:1,4-β-glucanase gene. This reduction might serve to keep the cell wall more flexible under microgravity conditions. This observation is in harmony with our data, revealing potential changes in the biosynthesis of cell wall non-cellulosic polysaccharides, in spaceflight environments. Interestingly, while these studies reported that glucan metabolism is impacted, the spaceflight environment (microgravity) seems to exert minimal influence on the metabolism of arabinoxylans. This differentiation in response indicates a level of specificity in how plants adjust their cell wall components in response to altered gravity. In the absence of gravity, seedlings have to default to secondary signals such as other environmental impulses. This affects internal homeostasis, inter- and intra-cellular transports, and cell wall composition. Our results identified intracellular Ca 2+ transport as a major player in adaptation to microgravity in both root and shoot. This is characterized by the increased abundance of the vacuolar proton ATPases and calcium-transporting ATPases. The vacuolar ATPases, contributing to the cytosolic pH homeostasis, form electrochemical proton gradients and drive active transport into cell organelles and they are important targets of phosphorylation and redox modification. The root-specific abundance of the cation transporters suggests that the homeostatic needs of the root differ from that of the shoot in spaceflight. The altered abundance of small GTPases such as Ran, Rab, and Ras, between spaceflight and Earth suggests a functional dysregulation of vesicle trafficking in spaceflight. The spaceflight environment alters molecular switches between the membrane-bound active GTP and cytosolic inactive GDP which tremendously affects signal transduction. Molecular mechanisms driving polar auxin distribution were affected and organ-specific, with the altered abundance of auxin transporters in spaceflight and on Earth. However, auxin transport and response appear to be more pronounced on Earth than in microgravity. Results from this study also suggest a decreased stability of the cellulose cell wall in spaceflight, due to the abundance of cellulose-degrading proteins and less abundance of cellulose synthase ( Table 2 ). The spaceflight environment led to the decreased formation and increased destabilization of the microtubules which suggests that seedlings seem to fall back on the actin skeleton for support. Interactions between PIP2 which is abundant in space, with VILLINs which were also abundant in space inhibit the capping and severing actions of actin but rather increase actin binding at the headpiece region. This suggests that actin cross-nucleation and cross-linking is an adaptation mechanism for plants in space. An in-depth study into vesicle and cargo sorting under microgravity will give more insight into how plants adapt their intracellular trafficking and cell wall depositions to the spaceflight environment. 4.3 Spaceflight significantly affects plant translation machinery in an organ-specific pattern The varied abundance of over 150 ribosomal subunit proteins, spliceosomes and proteasomes in spaceflight and across both organs suggest major alterations to plant transcriptional and translation machinery as an adaptation mechanism to the spaceflight environment ( Supplementary Tables E, F ). The decreased abundance of various mRNA slicing factors (ATO, CUV, SC35, SCL30A, U2AF65A, U2AF65B, DEAH3) in the shoot in spaceflight suggests less mRNA splicing in the shoot compared to the root, which might lead to the abundance of non-functional proteins in the shoot and increased need for proteasome activities. Combining transcript data with this proteome data will give more insight into this. The abundance of HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN families (HS60, HSP70, HSP90) in both organs suggests an increased control of protein homeostasis in space characterized by folding of nascent polypeptides released from the ribosome, sorting of proteins to cell organelles and providing a link to the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation. The relative abundance of 26S proteasomes involved in the degradation of misfolded and orphaned proteins suggests that the spaceflight environment led to errors in protein translation, hence the need to increase the efficiency of the proteasome unit. 4.4 Combating oxidative stress while maintaining ROS signaling in spaceflight Seedlings in spaceflight are faced with the need to maintain a balance between the abundance of ROS for systemic stress signaling and their damaging effects. Our results suggest dedicated efforts to the removal of superoxide radicals by the abundance of several peroxides, thioredoxin, ferritin, and superoxide dismutase in spaceflight. We infer that plants in spaceflight utilize a shunt pathway, which is a parallel alternative to the glycolytic pathway, to complement the NADPH production from the pentose-phosphate pathway. The pentose-phosphate shunt pathway is driven by NADPH demands in different tissues ( Aziz and Mohiuddin, 2022 ), and in this extremity, plants in spaceflight recycle inorganic phosphate from intracellular phosphate metabolites in the vacuole, mediated by PAP26 to meet the NADPH demands. This suggests that the metabolic energy requirement for plants in space is higher than on Earth. The abundance of aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) and several glutathione dehydrogenases suggests the involvement of the S-nitrosation reaction in cellular homeostasis in spaceflight. A common feature of the ALDHs is the susceptibility of their catalytic cysteine residue to GSNO-mediated S-nitrosation ( Stiti et al., 2020 ), which has been suggested as a central gravitropism signaling event ( Kruse and Wyatt, 2022 ). While this study substantiates that the BRIC LED hardware supports Arabidopsis plant growth in spaceflight, it is important to note that the BRIC hardware, unlike some newly developed advanced spaceflight hardware such as the Advance Plant Habitat (APH), is a closed system, hence no gas exchange between the plant and the external environment. This is a major limitation for the hardware, as this promotes the buildup of gases such as ethylene, oxygen and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) ( Klymchuk et al., 2003 ). Despite being an important hormone to plant, elevated ethylene level had been identified to cause anomalous Arabidopsis plant growth in spaceflight ( Stankovic, 2018 ) and sterility in male wheat plants grown in spaceflight ( Campbell et al., 2001 ). Beyond ethylene, the accumulation of oxygen and other VOCs can potentially reach toxic levels in the BRIC LED hardware. This is a substantial source of stress as indicated by Basu et al. (2017) . Drawing parallels with Earth, closed environments like terrariums might encounter similar challenges with gas accumulation. However, there’s a critical difference. On Earth, natural processes and microbial interactions often intervene to balance out the system over time. But in the unique microgravity setting of space, these natural balancing acts might not function as they do here, thereby amplifying the challenges of a closed system, as we consider plants for bio-regenerative life support in long-term spaceflight missions. 4.5 Non-correlated transcriptome and proteome: indicative of post-transcriptional regulation in spaceflight? Spaceflight environmental conditions pose unique challenges to plants, leading to significant alterations in gene expression and protein synthesis. Our analysis of Arabidopsis plants grown in space reveals that the expression of RNA transcripts did not correspond to their translation to shoot and root proteins. The observed non-correlation between transcriptome and proteome data from Arabidopsis plants grown in spaceflight may indeed suggest a prevalent post-transcriptional regulation ( Wang et al., 2022 ). Transcript-protein discordance can be attributed to multiple factors. One such factor is the differential extraction protocols and data processing for RNA and protein, which can introduce variation in the extracted quantities ( Liu et al., 2016 ). Furthermore, due to the unique environmental stressors of spaceflight, the mechanisms to arrest translation could be compromised, resulting in skewed protein synthesis rates. Moreover, the phenomenon of alternative splicing, often upregulated under stress conditions, can result in multiple protein isoforms from a single transcript, further complicating the correlation. Another source of discordance to note is that the RNA transcriptome might be a reflection of the plant’s immediate response to stress, while the proteome represents a more stabilized, adaptive response. These unique constraints of spaceflight can thus evoke distinct reactions at plants’ transcriptome and proteome levels, leading to non-correlated outcomes. Hence, attributing the non-correlation of the transcriptome and proteome only to alternative splicing will be a bias. This study, by combining transcriptomics and proteomics, provided insight into plants’ adaptive responses to the spaceflight environment at multiple molecular levels. While we did not directly measure photosynthetic net production, our findings indicate a series of modifications to photosystems II and I aimed at adapting to the space environment, potentially decreasing the plant’s sensitivity to light intensity and enhancing its oxygen-evolving capacity. Concurrently, we observed evidence for an increased metabolic energy requirement in spaceflight, with plants seemingly engaging alternate energy generation pathways to complement photosynthetic production. Furthermore, our findings indicate significant impacts on cellular trafficking and potential compromises to cell wall integrity, suggesting an adaptation in structural support provided by actin filament cross-linking and cross-nucleation. This research not only serves as a comprehensive study of plant response in spaceflight but also holds profound implications for terrestrial agriculture, providing valuable insights for developing crop varieties resilient to environmental stressors on Earth, such as drought, extreme temperatures, and salinity. This study also contributes to the broader goal of space agriculture – a key component of long-duration space missions and off-Earth colonization. While centered around the model plant Arabidopsis, our findings could provide the foundation for developing crop varieties suitable for growth in extraterrestrial environments, supporting food production for future missions to Mars and the Moon. Thus, the findings of our research, while intrinsically fascinating, also bear practical implications for the future of both terrestrial and space agriculture. As we continue to explore the final frontier, understanding how life – in this case, plant life – adapts and thrives is crucial for the success of our extraterrestrial endeavors and the sustainable development of our agriculture on Earth.","Data availability statement The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.

As A. niger is a predominant ISS isolate frequently detected in built environments, studies of A. niger strains inhabiting closed systems may reveal information fundamental to the success of long-duration space missions. This investigation provides valuable insights into the adaptive mechanisms of fungi in extreme environments as well as countermeasures to eradicate unfavorable microbes. Further, it enhances understanding of host-microbe interactions in closed systems, which can help NASA’s Human Research Program maintain a habitat healthy for crew during long-term manned space missions.",INTRODUCTION,MATERIALS AND METHODS,RESULTS,DISCUSSION,"MATERIALS AND METHODS Isolation and identification of the ISS A. niger isolate. Surface samples were collected from the U.S. segment of the ISS using the Surface Sampling kit (SSK) (NASA, 2011). Microbes were removed from surfaces using a swab and sterile saline solution (0.85% sodium chloride) and were transported to Earth for analyses. Materials retrieved from the swabs were subsequently inoculated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) supplemented with chloramphenicol. The PDA plates were incubated at ambient cabin temperature (28° to 37°C) for 5 days. The fungal colonies that exhibited growth were further purified and stored at −80°C in sterile glycerol stock until further analyses. When required, fungal isolates were revived on PDA medium, and DNA from pure cultures was extracted (UltraPure DNA kit [Mo Bio, Carlsbad, CA]). An approximately 600-bp region consisting of ITS 1, 5.8S, and ITS 2 of the isolated fungal DNA was PCR amplified, using primers ITS1F (5′ TTG GTC ATT TAG AGG AAG TAA 3′) and Tw13 (5′ GGT CCG TGT TTC AAG ACG 3′) ( 63 ) and following the established protocol ( 64 ). The UNITE database was used to determine the closest similarity to ITS sequences of fungal type strains ( 65 ). The identity of the ISS isolate was subsequently confirmed by WGS. Genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation. Extracted DNA was sent to the Macrogen clinical laboratory (Macrogen Inc., Rockville, MD, USA) for WGS. Library preparation was carried out using the Illumina Nextera kit (random fragmentation, adapter ligation, and cluster generation) and quantified with Quant-iT double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) high-sensitivity assays. Generated libraries were sequenced with 100-bp paired-end sequencing protocols on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Raw data images were produced utilizing HCS (HiSeq Control Software v2.2.38) for system control, and base calling (BCL) was done through an integrated primary analysis using Real Time Analysis software v1.18.61.0. The BCL binary was converted into FASTQ utilizing Illumina package bcl2fastq (v1.8.4). The NGS QC Toolkit version 2.3 ( 66 ) was used to filter the data for high-quality vector- and adapter-free reads for genome assembly (cutoff read length for high quality, 80%; cutoff quality score, 20), and 22,769,466 vector filter reads were obtained after the quality check. High-quality vector-filtered reads were used for de novo assembly with the MaSuRCA genome assembler (k-mer size, 70) ( 67 ). The final assembly consisted of 223 scaffolds with a total size of 36,079,011 bp (∼100×). The N 50 scaffold length was 543,773 kb, and the largest scaffold was 1,390.254 kb. There was no random “N” joining of the contigs to maintain high assembly quality. Quality check of the final assembly was performed using the quality assessment tool for genome assemblies (QUAST) ( 68 ). The number of N’s detected was less than 12 per 100 kb, which represents very good assembly. Genome annotation was performed with funannotate ( 69 ) ( https://github.com/nextgenusfs/funannotate ; v1.3.0-beta), which utilizes a combination of ab initio gene prediction tools ( 70 , 71 ) and experimental evidence including proteins and transcriptome sequencing (RNA sequencing) and a consensus gene calling with EvidenceModeler ( 72 ). Phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of A. niger strains was performed by identifying conserved protein coding genes in available A. niger genomes and close relatives. These data were obtained by downloading public sequence data from NCBI and the Department of Energy’s Joint Genome Institute (JGI) Mycocosm. The assemblies for strains A1, ATCC 10864, An76, FDAARGOS 311, FGSC A1279, H915-1, L2, and SH-2 were downloaded from the NCBI Assembly Archive. The strains FDAARGOS 311 and An76 already had deposited annotations and were downloaded directly. For the remaining strains, gene prediction with Augustus (v 3.2.2) ( 70 ) used the pretrained model ‘aspergillus_niger_jsc_093350089’ generated from the genome annotation procedure. This parameter set is deposited in https://github.com/hyphaltip/fungi-gene-prediction-params . Additional strains with annotation from JGI were downloaded (ATCC 1015, DSM 1, CBS 513.88, and NRRL 3) along with related species ( A. niger van Tieghem ATCC 13496, A. welwitschiae CBS 139.54b, A. phoenicis , A. lacticoffeatus CBS 101883, and A. brasiliensis CBS 101740). Coding sequences were obtained, translated into proteins, and searched for a conserved set of 71 protein coding gene markers, “AFTOL_70,” as part of the 1000 Fungal Genomes project ( https://github.com/1KFG/Phylogenomics_HMMs ). These markers were searched using PHYling ( https://github.com/stajichlab/PHYling_unified ), which first searches for conserved markers using HMMsearch followed by extraction of best hits and concatenated alignment of all the orthologous matches. A back-translated alignment of coding sequences was produced from the input proteins in order to resolve the closely related strains in this data set. A phylogenetic tree was inferred from the coding sequence tree using IQTREE (v1.6.3) first by identifying a partition scheme with -m TESTMERGE -st CODON parameters followed by a tree inference using the options -st CODON -bb 1000 -spp Partition.txt to infer the tree and obtain branch support with ultrafast bootstrapping on the reduced partition parameters under a codon model in IQTREE ( 73 – 75 ). To identify the number of single nucleotide variations occurring between JSC-093350089 and both ATCC 1015 and CBS 513.88, variants were called using the Harvest suite’s Parsnp tool ( 76 ). Growth conditions. JSC-093350089 and ATCC 1015 were cultivated on 10-cm petri dishes containing 25-ml glucose minimal medium (GMM) agar plates (6 g/liter NaNO 3 , 0.52 g/liter KCl, 0.52 g/liter MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O, 1.52 g/liter KH 2 PO 4 , 10 g/liter d- glucose, 15 g/liter agar supplemented with 1 ml/liter of Hutner’s trace elements) with a cellophane membrane on top, on which the fungus was grown. Unless otherwise specified, 1 × 10 7 conidia per petri dish ( D = 10 cm) were inoculated into each medium and incubated at 30°C for 5 days. Physiological analysis. Growth rates were assessed by centrally inoculating 1 × 10 4 conidia on GMM plates in replicates of 5 and measuring radial growth at the same time each day. Statistical analyses were performed using multiple t tests and corrected for multiple comparisons using the Holm-Sidak method. Photos depicting morphological differences were taken after 7 days. Protein extraction. Mycelia from GMM agar plates were collected and stored at −80°C prior to protein extraction. For protein extraction, the lysis buffer consisted of 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) with 1× Halt protease inhibitor cocktail (100×), with the final concentration of each component being 1 mM AEBSF [4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride], 800 nM aprotinin, 50 μM bestatin, 15 μM E64, 20 μM leupeptin, and 10 μM pepstatin A (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) and 200 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Mycelia were homogenized directly using Precellys 24 homogenizer (Bertin, Rockville, MD) in which each sample was processed inside a 2-ml cryotube with 0.5-mm glass beads three times (at 4°C and 6,500 rpm for 1 min., repeated 3 times with 15-s pauses in between). The lysed fungi were centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 15 min. Protein concentrations in the supernatants were measured by the Bradford assay with albumin for the standard curve (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA). Tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling. Two hundred micrograms of proteins from each sample was precipitated in 20% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) at 4°C. Protein pellets were obtained by centrifugation (17,000 × g ), washed with ice-cold acetone, and resuspended in 25 µl TEAB (50 mM final concentration) and 25 µl 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) (50% final concentration). Proteins were reduced by adding 1 µl of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP; 500 mM) followed by incubation for 1 h at 37°C (10 mM final TCEP concentration). Proteins were alkylated in the presence of iodoacetamide (IAA; 30 mM) in the dark for 1 h at room temperature. A 2.5-µg-per-sample quantity of mass-spectrometry-grade trypsin-LysC (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to digest the peptides overnight at 37°C. The digested peptides were quantified using the Pierce quantitative colorimetric peptide assay (Thermo Scientific). Forty micrograms of peptides from each specific sample was labeled with the Thermo Scientific TMTsixplex isobaric mass tagging kit (ATCC 1015-GMM with TMT 6 -128, and JSC-GMM with TMT 6 -129) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The TMT 6 -130 and -131 labels were used as a reference that contained an equal amount of the peptides from each of the four samples. All labeled-peptide mixtures were combined into a single tube, mixed, and fractionated using the Thermo Scientific Pierce high-pH reversed-phase peptide fractionation kit. Fractions were dried using a SpeedVac concentrator and resuspended in 1% formic acid prior to LC-tandem MS (MS/MS) analysis. LC-MS/MS analysis. The samples were analyzed on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer with an Easy-nLC 1000 liquid chromatograph, a 75-μm by 2-cm Acclaim PepMap100 C 18 trapping column, a 75-μm by 25-cm PepMap RSLC C 18 analytical column, and an Easy-Spray ion source (Thermo Scientific). The column temperature was maintained at 45°C, and the peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 300 nl/min over a 110-min gradient, from 3 to 30% solvent B (100 min), 30 to 50% solvent B (3 min), 50 to 90% solvent B (2 min), and 90% solvent B (2 min). Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in water, and solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The full MS survey scan ( m/z 400 to 1,500) was acquired in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 120,000 and an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 2 × 10 5 . The maximum injection time for MS scans was 50 ms. Monoisotopic precursor ions were selected with charge states 2 to 7, a ±10-ppm mass window, and 70-s dynamic exclusion. The MS 2 scan ( m/z 400 to 2,000) was performed using the linear ion trap with the collision-induced dissociation (CID) collision energy set to 35%. The ion trap scan rate was set to “rapid,” with an AGC target of 4 × 10 3 and a maximum injection time of 150 ms. Ten fragment ions from each MS 2 experiment were subsequently selected for an MS 3 experiment. The MS 3 scan ( m/z 100 to 500) was performed to generate the TMT reporter ions in the linear ion trap using heated capillary dissociation (HCD) at a collision energy setting of 55%, a rapid scan rate and an AGC target of 5 × 10 3 , and a maximum injection time of 250 ms. Proteome data analysis. All MS spectra were searched using the Proteome Discoverer (version 2.1.0.81; Thermo Scientific) with the Sequest-HT searching engines against an Aspergillus niger CBS 513.88 database containing 10,549 sequences (NCBI). The searches were performed with the following parameters: 5-ppm tolerance for precursor ion masses and 0.6-Da tolerance for fragment ion masses. The static modification settings included carbamidomethyl of cysteine residues and dynamic modifications included oxidation of methionine, TMTsixplex modification of lysine ε-amino groups and peptide N termini, and acetyl modification of protein N terminus. A target-decoy database search was used to set a false-discovery rate (FDR) of 1%. The reporter ion integration tolerance was 0.5 Da. The coisolation threshold was 75%. The average signal-to-noise threshold of all reporter peaks was bigger than 10. The total intensity of a reporter ion for a protein was calculated based on the sum of all detected reporter ions of associated peptides from that protein. The ratios between reporter ions and the reference reporter ions (TMT 6 -130 or -131) were used to estimate the abundance ratio of each protein. For statistical analysis, the sum of reporter ion intensities for each protein was log 2 transformed and the technical triplicate measurements for each protein were averaged. Only the proteins that were identified with at least one peptide detected in each technical replicate, and quantified in all three technical replicates, were considered for the analysis. Student’s t test was performed to identify proteins that are differentially expressed. Proteins with P values of <0.05 were further evaluated for increased or decreased abundance using a cutoff value of log 2 fold change of >|1|. Data availability.

Unfortunately, few of these experiments have involved monocot plants, which constitute most of the crops used on Earth as sources of food, feed, and fiber. To better understand the ability of monocot plants to adapt to spaceflight, we germinated and grew Brachypodium distachyon seedlings of the Bd21, Bd21-3, and Gaz8 accessions in a customized growth unit on the International Space Station, along with 1-g ground controls. At the end of a 4-day growth period, seedling organ’s growth and morphologies were quantified, and root and shoot transcriptomic profiles were investigated using RNA-seq. The roots of all three accessions grew more slowly and displayed longer root hairs under microgravity conditions relative to ground control. On the other hand, the shoots of Bd21-3 and Gaz-8 grew at similar rates between conditions, whereas those of Bd21 grew more slowly under microgravity. The three Brachypodium accessions displayed dramatically different transcriptomic responses to microgravity relative to ground controls, with the largest numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) found in Gaz8 (4527), followed by Bd21 (1353) and Bd21-3 (570). Only 47 and six DEGs were shared between accessions for shoots and roots, respectively, including DEGs encoding wall-associated proteins and photosynthesis-related DEGs. Furthermore, DEGs associated with the “Oxidative Stress Response” GO group were up-regulated in the shoots and down-regulated in the roots of Bd21 and Gaz8, indicating that Brachypodium roots and shoots deploy distinct biological strategies to adapt to the microgravity environment. A comparative analysis of the Brachypodium oxidative-stress response DEGs with the Arabidopsis ROS wheel suggests a connection between retrograde signaling, light response, and decreased expression of photosynthesis-related genes in microgravity-exposed shoots. In Gaz8, DEGs were also found to preferentially associate with the “Plant Hormonal Signaling” and “MAP Kinase Signaling” KEGG pathways. Overall, these data indicate that Brachypodium distachyon seedlings exposed to the microgravity environment of ISS display accession- and organ-specific responses that involve oxidative stress response, wall remodeling, photosynthesis inhibition, expression regulation, ribosome biogenesis, and post-translational modifications. The general characteristics of these responses are similar to those displayed by microgravity-exposed Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. However, organ- and accession-specific components of the response dramatically differ both within and between species. These results suggest a need to directly evaluate candidate-crop responses to microgravity to better understand their specific adaptability to this novel environment and develop cultivation strategies allowing them to strive during spaceflight.",1.

A wide range of experiments have shown that plant physiological adaptation to spaceflight involves gene expression changes that alter cell wall and other metabolisms. However, while transcriptome profiling aptly illuminates changes in gene expression that accompany spaceflight adaptation, mutation analysis is required to illuminate key elements required for that adaptation. Here we report how transcriptome profiling was used to gain insight into the spaceflight adaptation role of Altered response to gravity 1 ( Arg1 ), a gene known to affect gravity responses in plants on Earth. The study compared expression profiles of cultured lines of Arabidopsis thaliana derived from wild-type (WT) cultivar Col-0 to profiles from a knock-out line deficient in the gene encoding ARG1 (ARG1 KO), both on the ground and in space. The cell lines were launched on SpaceX CRS-2 as part of the Cellular Expression Logic (CEL) experiment of the BRIC-17 spaceflight mission. The cultured cell lines were grown within 60 mm Petri plates in Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFUs) that were housed within the Biological Research In Canisters (BRIC) hardware. Spaceflight samples were fixed on orbit. Differentially expressed genes were identified between the two environments (spaceflight and comparable ground controls) and the two genotypes (WT and ARG1 KO). Each genotype engaged unique genes during physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment, with little overlap. Most of the genes altered in expression in spaceflight in WT cells were found to be Arg1 -dependent, suggesting a major role for that gene in the physiological adaptation of undifferentiated cells to spaceflight.

The OMG1 5′ flanking region is an active promoter in cells where ROS activity is commonly observed, such as in pollen tubes, root hairs, and in other tissues upon wounding. qRT-PCR analyses revealed that upon wounding on Earth, OMG1 is an apparent transcriptional regulator of MYB77 and GRX480 , which are associated with the ROS pathway. Fluorescence-based ROS assays show that OMG1 affects ROS production. Phylogenetic analysis of OMG1 and closely related homologs suggests that OMG1 is a distant, unrecognized member of the CONSTANS-Like protein family, a member that arose via gene duplication early in the angiosperm lineage and subsequently lost its first DNA-binding B-box1 domain. These data illustrate that members of the rapidly evolving COL protein family play a role in regulating ROS pathway functions, and their differential regulation on orbit suggests a role for ROS signalling in spaceflight physiological adaptation.",Introduction,Materials and Methods,Results,Discussion,"ROSMETER analysis The ROSMETER tool assesses the ROS-related transcriptomic signature in a large-scale Arabidopsis gene expression data set ( Rosenwasser et al. 2013 ). Arabidopsis gene expression profiles from two independent spaceflight experiments, APEX01 and Advanced Plant Experiment 03-2 (APEX03-2), along with their corresponding ground controls, were used to correlate differential gene expression in spaceflight with specific ROS species and origins. The APEX01 experiment utilized two ecotypes and both were planted on each plate of the experiment. Since the entire plate was harvested on orbit to a single tube, the subsequent transcriptomic analyses comprised 60 % Wassilewskija (WS) and 40 % Col-0 ( Paul et al. 2013b ). In the APEX03-2 data set, WS and Col-0 were kept on separate plates, harvested into separate tubes and analysed individually. A data set from Col-0 compared to WS vertically grown in standard laboratory conditions was included as an additional control ( Schultz et al. 2017 ). From each data set, Affymetrix Probeset-ID, Gene Locus ID, P -value and fold change were listed and submitted to ROSMETER. The heatmap was constructed using the GENE-E software with hierarchical clustering using the Matrix value offered in the software.","Plant materials and growth conditions Seeds from both Col-0 and WS were prepared for APEX01 and APEX03-2 as previously described ( Paul et al. 2012b , 2013b ; Sng et al. 2014 ; Ferl and Paul 2016 ). Briefly, plants were cultured on Phytagel™ 10 cm Petri plates and grown either in the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) hardware (APEX01), or in the Veggie hardware (APEX03-2) under continuous lighting of ~80–135 μmol m −2 s −1 PAR. In this study, the effects of the spaceflight environment were evaluated, which includes ambient radiation, microgravity and attending effects on convection. In both experiments, the ground control plants were grown with a 24- to 48-h schedule delay that allowed the comparable ground growth chambers to be programmed with the precise environmental conditions that the International Space Station (ISS)-grown plants received on orbit.

Arabidopsis thaliana cell cultures derived from wild type (WT) ecotype Col-0 and a knockout line deficient in the gene encoding HSFA2 (HSFA2 KO) were grown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to ascertain whether the HSF network functions in the adaptation to the novel environment of spaceflight. Microarray gene expression data were analyzed using a two-part comparative approach. First, genes differentially expressed between the two environments (spaceflight to ground) were identified within the same genotype, which represented physiological adaptation to spaceflight. Second, gene expression profiles were compared between the two genotypes (HSFA2 KO to WT) within the same environment, which defined genes uniquely required by each genotype on the ground and in spaceflight-adapted states. Results showed that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) define the HSFA2 KO cells’ physiological state irrespective of the environment, and likely resulted from a deficiency in the chaperone-mediated protein folding machinery in the mutant. Results further suggested that additional to its universal stress response role, HsfA2 also has specific roles in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight through cell wall remodeling, signal perception and transduction, and starch biosynthesis. Disabling HsfA2 altered the physiological state of the cells, and impacted the mechanisms induced to adapt to spaceflight, and identified HsfA2 -dependent genes that are important to the adaption of wild type cells to spaceflight.

An elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a potential biomarker candidate, as leukocyte differentials are altered during spaceflight. In the reduced gravity environment of space, rodents and astronauts displayed elevated NLR and granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratios (GLR), respectively. To simulate microgravity using two well-established ground-based models, we cultured human whole blood-leukocytes in high-aspect rotating wall vessels (HARV-RWV) and used hindlimb unloaded (HU) mice. Both HARV-RWV simulation of leukocytes and HU-exposed mice showed elevated NLR profiles comparable to spaceflight exposed samples. To assess mechanisms involved, we found the simulated microgravity HARV-RWV model resulted in an imbalance of redox processes and activation of myeloperoxidase-producing inflammatory neutrophils, while antioxidant treatment reversed these effects. In the simulated microgravity HU model, mitochondrial catalase-transgenic mice that have reduced oxidative stress responses showed reduced neutrophil counts, NLR, and a dampened release of selective inflammatory cytokines compared to wildtype HU mice, suggesting simulated microgravity induced oxidative stress responses that triggered inflammation. In brief, both spaceflight and simulated microgravity models caused elevated NLR, indicating this as a potential biomarker for future in-flight immune health monitoring.",Introduction,Materials and Methods,Results,Discussion,"Discussion Spaceflight causes immune dysfunction that can lead to health risks for astronauts. Health risks that arise from immune dysfunction are complex and include an inability to defend against pathogens, altered tolerance to self-antigens resulting in potential autoimmunity development, chronic inflammation, and immune senescence. Therefore, mitigation during spaceflight will likely require selective targeting of specific immune cell types and/or developmental stages. Elevated NLR may be a prospective biomarker candidate to identify immune deviations that can cause disease. Currently, elevated NLR is used as a clinical biomarker to detect sub-clinical inflammation in humans and predicts poor prognosis in cancer ( 18 ). In this study, a spike in GLR in humans and NLR in rodents was observed at landing and elevated GLR and NLR were observed during spaceflight ( Figure 1 ). In humans, GLR was elevated at 180-days in-flight, suggesting prolonged exposure to spaceflight caused leukocyte differential changes. This change in immune differentials may be in response to elevated inflammation experienced in-flight ( 4 , 6 , 12 ), since elevated, chronic inflammation is often coupled with immune dysfunction and disease development ( 13 , 19 , 20 , 67 – 70 ). Therefore, monitoring distinct biomarkers, such as elevated NLR, can determine when countermeasures can intervene to avert immune dysfunction, promote immune recovery, and prevent disease development. Elevated numbers of granulocytes and neutrophils were observed in vitro following 20 h of HARV-RWV modeled microgravity in human peripheral blood ( Figure 2 and Figure S1 ). However, since mature neutrophils are terminally differentiated in blood circulation, i.e., banded or segmented neutrophils, we estimate that this increased percentage is due to increased scatter properties indicative of cellular activation. Indeed, elevated cell surface expression of CD66b and CD11b per granulocyte, which are activation markers for neutrophils ( 58 , 59 ), were increased in sµg ( Figure 3 and Figure S1 ). Further studies revealed elevated ROS and MPO expression ( Figure 3 ), confirming HARV-RWV sµg resulted in granulocytes, and in particular, neutrophil activation. Physiological effects of elevated active granulocytes or neutrophils in circulation intensifies sterile inflammation ( 70 – 72 ), promotes edema, and non-specific tissue damage ( 73 ), and can threaten astronaut health if not adequately controlled. Interestingly, MPO gene expression ( Figure 5D ) was elevated in HU, suggesting immature neutrophil entry into blood circulation, compared to neutrophil activation observed in vitro in the HARV-RWV. MPO gene synthesis only occurs in bone marrow early in neutrophil development, i.e. immature neutrophils (myeloblasts, promyelocytes, and myelocytes). MPO gene expression ends once neutrophils differentiate into metamyelocytes ( 74 ) and synthesized MPO protein is packaged into granules released during neutrophil activation ( 75 ). Typically, immature neutrophils are not released into blood circulation unless the body is in a diseased or inflammatory state ( 74 , 75 ). However, since MPO gene expression was elevated in HU mice blood, this suggests the potential for myelocyte/immature neutrophil infiltration and may also serve as a biomarker for elevated inflammation during spaceflight. To our knowledge no measurements have been recorded for elevated immature neutrophils in blood circulation in-flight; however, elevated neutrophils were identified in blood from 9 of 16 astronauts at landing ( 6 , 76 , 77 ). As compared to the rodent spaceflight results (in-flight day 14), elevated neutrophils were also observed at days 14 and 30 of HU in mice ( Figures 4C and 5A ), suggesting the physical effects of fluid-shifting experienced during spaceflight and HU may stimulate the release of neutrophils into circulation; however this requires further investigation. Indeed, elevated MPO during sµg may contribute to immune dysfunction. MPO catalyzes hydrogen peroxide into reactive intermediates that can damage proteins, lipids, and DNA ( 67 ). Excess MPO impairs phagocytic function ( 67 – 69 ) and triggers neutrophil degranulation, causing inflammatory tissue damage ( 78 ) in cardiovascular disease ( 62 , 67 , 79 ). Pathologically this is relevant during spaceflight, as cardiovascular disease is a prominent risk factor associated with returned astronauts ( 80 ). Furthermore, elevated NLR is currently used as a predictor of cardiovascular disease risk on Earth ( 81 ), thereby highlighting the clinical relevance of monitoring NLR during spaceflight. Neutrophil oxidative burst responses and elevated ROS can induce cellular death ( 82 ), including lymphocyte apoptosis ( 83 ), and suppression of T lymphocyte function ( 84 ). HARV-RWV sµg induced ROS in granulocytes, indicating HARV-RWV sµg activated granulocytes and triggered the oxidative burst response. Thus HARV-RWV sµg can serve as a valuable model to study ROS-induced inflammation ( 72 , 85 ). Indeed, redox imbalance occurs in humans and cell cultures exposed to spaceflight ( 4 – 6 ) and in vitro ground-based sµg models ( 8 , 9 , 86 ). The cause of elevated ROS in sµg may be due to: (1) cell death factors or other unknown stimulators of the oxidative burst response, (2) a mechanosensitive stress receptor in phagocytes that triggers redox imbalance ( 87 ), and/or (3) a combination of these effects. In our study, HARV-RWV sµg induced active Caspase 3/7 expression in lymphocyte populations ( Figure 2D ), indicating lymphocyte apoptosis and shifting of immune differentials to favor higher NLR and GLR. Further analyses of our in vivo HU studies revealed no difference in lymphocyte percent or absolute count populations ( Figures 4 and 5 , and Figures S2 and 3 ) compared to HARV-RWV sµg studies, suggesting elevated lymphocyte recovery or unknown ROS-quenching mechanisms that limit lymphocyte apoptosis, both of which require further studies. Therefore, the two sµg models, HARV-RWV and HU, displayed different mechanisms towards generating an elevated NLR. The HARV-RWV microgravity model appears to display robust lymphocyte turnover, i.e. elevated lymphocyte apoptosis, and most likely immune function that may differ from astronauts in-flight. However, this does not rule out that lymphocyte apoptosis does not occur in vivo HU, as turnover of lymphocytes to replace loss most likely occurs, albeit apoptosis may occur at a slower rate than in vitro HARV-RWV. Furthermore, ROS concentration within each sµg model may be drastically different. For example, ROS levels in HARV-RWV may be much higher in the absence of in vivo ROS quenchers compared to 14- or 30-day HU, which would affect the rate of lymphocyte apoptosis ( 88 , 89 ). Indeed, concentration and exposure time of ROS determines cellular responses. Homeostatic levels of ROS can promote cell survival, while elevated ROS (oxidative stress) can induce cellular death ( 82 ). In line with this, the timeline of measurements of lymphocyte counts (20 h HARV-RWV versus 14- and 30-days HU) differ between the two models; therefore direct comparisons cannot be assumed. Finally, the HARV-RWV model cultured human blood samples, which have different leukocyte percentages compared to mice leukocytes in the HU model; therefore the kinetics of apoptosis across the two microgravity models would also be affected. Crucian et al. showed there is an elevation of granulocytes in blood circulation, while no differences are observed in lymphocyte absolute counts, suggesting lymphocytes may not undergo apoptosis in spaceflight; rather there may be release of more granulocytes into blood circulation ( 29 ). Controversially however, multiple reports have indicated lymphocytes and lymphocyte-like cell lines undergo apoptosis during spaceflight/microgravity conditions ( 36 – 42 ), albeit measurements were either reported post-landing or from ex vivo cell cultures in flight. In fact, the role of apoptosis in lymphocyte depression (ROALD) experiment that was part of the BIO-4 mission and comprised of ESA, Energia, and NASA agencies, was performed with the goal to understand how microgravity affects lymphocyte apoptosis. The results showed after 48 h on-board the ISS ex vivo cultures of lymphocytes displayed increased DNA fragmentation, PARP protein expression, and elevated p53 expression, compared to ground controls ( 36 ). Due to this, we believe the in vivo HU microgravity model, although having its own limitations, may be a better representative ground-based model for spaceflight. Nonetheless, additional studies are required to better understand the degree of lymphocyte turnover during in vivo HU that is comparable to spaceflight. Monocytes were significantly reduced following HARV-RWV ( Figure 2B ); however no differences were observed in HU mice ( Figures S2D, E ), further indicating the variability between the two simulated microgravity models. Yet, inconsistency with these cell types in terms of population differentials have also been noted across spaceflight literature ( 77 , 90 , 91 ), which may be a factor of sampling timepoints. However, consensus suggests phagocytic function of monocytes following spaceflight is impaired ( 92 , 93 ). Phagocytic impairment of monocytes can directly affect clearance of neutrophils from circulation, inflammation resolution ( 94 ), and can impact NLR. Therefore, further research into the function and distribution of monocytes following simulated microgravity are currently underway. Transgenic mice expressing the human antioxidant gene catalase reversed HU-induced elevation of NLR and dampened inflammatory gene expression ( Figure 5 ), suggesting redox imbalance caused leukocyte differential changes. In line with this, mice deficient in apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a protein with antioxidant activity, display elevated ROS expression and activated neutrophils ( 95 ). In our study, HARV-RWV sµg of human leukocytes induced neutrophil activation that was reversed in the presence of the antioxidant NAC ( Figure 3D ), further suggesting antioxidants can suppress inflammation. Indeed, in vivo NAC treatment successfully ameliorated acetic acid-induced colitis by reversing pro-inflammatory mediators TNF-α, IL-6, and MPO in rats ( 96 ). Collectively, these results indicate antioxidants as viable countermeasures to regulate spaceflight-induced inflammation and immune dysfunction. Clinically, elevated NLR (>3.53) ( 27 ) is a prognostic indicator for cancer development, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, and infectious conditions ( 18 , 21 – 23 , 25 ), but no NLR standard has been established for astronaut immunity. Our results revealed elevated GLR in astronauts at landing (GLR = 3.6, Figure 1B ), compared to clinically relevant GLR (>2.24) ( 97 ), may result in biological significance for astronaut health. Although restoration to normal GLR occurred at landing on Earth, landing on the lunar surface and/or Mars, where gravity is less than Earth’s, may pose a significant risk to astronaut immune recovery. Therefore, monitoring and developing countermeasures to mitigate elevated NLR, GLR, and inflammatory neutrophil phenotypes for future long-duration and long-distance space travel are essential for mission success. In summary, we identified increased GLR and NLR in both human and rodent spaceflight samples and ground simulations of microgravity. Our results in vitro indicated that leukocytes shift in favor of elevated activated inflammatory neutrophils, which may amplify disease development in vivo . Further, antioxidants may be useful countermeasures to ameliorate these outcomes in sµg, as NAC treatment inhibited activated inflammatory human neutrophils in HARV-RWV and catalase partially mitigated elevated NLR in HU mice. Based on these findings, we suggest monitoring both in-flight and landing NLR to assess astronaut immune status. We further advocate the investigation of antioxidants as future countermeasures to mitigate immune deviations, including elevated NLR and inflammation, to safeguard astronaut health on future missions.",Data Availability Statement The data analyzed in this study are subject to the following licenses/restrictions: NASA Life Sciences Data Archive (LSDA) is an active repository for astronaut health datasets.

Under investigation here is whether epigenetic modulations, similar to those that occur in terrestrial stress responses, have a functional role in spaceflight physiological adaptation. The Advanced Plant Experiment-04 – Epigenetic Expression experiment examined the role of cytosine methylation in spaceflight adaptation. The experiment was conducted onboard the International Space Station, and evaluated the spaceflight-altered, genome-wide methylation profiles of two methylation-regulating gene mutants [methyltransferase 1 ( met1-7) and elongator complex subunit 2 ( elp2-5 )] along with a wild-type Col-0 control. Results: The elp2-5 plants suffered in their physiological adaptation to spaceflight in that their roots failed to extend away from the seed and the overall development of the plants was greatly impaired in space. The met1-7 plants suffered less, with their morphology affected by spaceflight in a manner similar to that of the Col-0 controls. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in spaceflight were dramatically different in the elp2-5 and met1-7 plants compared to Col-0, indicating that the disruptions in these mutants resulted in a reprogramming of their spaceflight responses, especially in elp2-5 . Many of the genes comprising the spaceflight transcriptome of each genotype were differentially methylated in spaceflight. In Col-0 the majority of the DEGs were representative of the now familiar spaceflight response, which includes genes associated with cell wall remodeling, pathogen responses and ROS signaling. However, the spaceflight transcriptomes of met1-7 and elp2-5 each presented patterns of DEGs that are almost completely different than Col-0, and to each other. Further, the DEGs of the mutant genotypes suggest a more severe spaceflight stress response in the mutants, particularly in elp2-5 . Conclusion: Arabidopsis physiological adaptation to spaceflight results in differential DNA methylation in an organ-specific manner. Disruption of Met1 methyltransferase function does not dramatically affect spaceflight growth or morphology, yet met1-7 reprograms the spaceflight transcriptomic response in a unique manner.

However, the red blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit and the CD8+ T cytotoxic (Tc) cell count and percentage all decreased, while both the CD4:CD8 (Th:Tc) cell ratio and spontaneous blastogenesis increased, in one or more irradiated groups compared with unirradiated controls ( P < 0.05 vs 0 Gy). In contrast, splenic WBC, lymphocyte, B cell and T helper (Th) counts, %B cells and the CD4:CD8 ratio were all significantly elevated, while Tc percentages decreased, in one or more of the irradiated groups compared with controls ( P < 0.05 vs 0 Gy). Although there were trends for minor, radiation-induced increases in %CD11b+ granulocytes in the spleen, cells double-labeled with adhesion markers (CD11b+CD54+, CD11b+CD62E+) were normal. Splenocyte spontaneous blastogenesis and that induced by mitogens (PHA, ConA, LPS) was equivalent to normal. In bone marrow, the percentage of cells expressing stem cell markers, Sca-1 and CD34/Sca-1, were low in one or more of the irradiated groups ( P < 0.05 vs 0 Gy). Collectively, the data indicate that significant immunological abnormalities still exist more than a month after 56 Fe irradiation and that there are differences dependent upon body compartment.",INTRODUCTION,MATERIALS AND METHODS,RESULTS,DISCUSSION,,,Changes in the distribution and function of leukocytes after whole-body iron ion irradiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5045078/,

Although there were increases noted in corticosterone levels in both the adrenals and liver, there were no significant changes in catecholamine levels. Furthermore, functional analysis of gene expression and metabolomic profiles suggest that the functional changes are not due to oxidative or psychological stress.

We outline future research directions toward the goal of enhancing human radioresistance, including upregulation of endogenous repair and radioprotective mechanisms, possible leeways into gene therapy in order to enhance radioresistance via the translation of exogenous and engineered DNA repair and radioprotective mechanisms, the substitution of organic molecules with fortified isoforms, and methods of slowing metabolic activity while preserving cognitive function. We conclude by presenting the known associations between radioresistance and longevity, and articulating the position that enhancing human radioresistance is likely to extend the healthspan of human spacefarers as well.",INTRODUCTION,,,,"RADIATION DNA DAMAGE AND MECHANISMS OF REPAIR All eukaryotic organisms have evolved against a backdrop of constant exposure to endogenous and exogenous mutagens, and as such have developed robust cellular mechanisms for DNA repair and protection against DNA damage. The mechanisms of cellular protection against DNA damage and mutation and of DNA repair can be categorized as immediate and adaptive defense mechanisms. Immediate defense mechanisms include: The production of antioxidants and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers that neutralize ROS produced by oxygen metabolism, ionizing radiation and UV radiation [ 40 – 43 ]. DNA repair [ 44 – 47 ], including direct reversal repair, base excision repair (BER) [ 48 – 51 ], nucleotide excision repair (NER) [ 52 – 54 ] and mismatch repair [ 44 – 47 ] for single strand modifications, and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ), homologous recombination for double strand breaks (DSBs), and interstrand crosslink repair for modifications affecting both strands [ 55 – 58 ]; Elimination of damaged cells via apoptosis [ 59 – 64 ], and Proliferative arrest and replicative senescence [ 55 – 58 , 65 , 66 ] Substantial experimental evidence suggests that low-dose radiation may trigger a variety of protective responses within cells, tissues and organisms that serve to protect them from both exogenous (e.g high doses of radiation) [ 67 ] and endogenous (e.g. age-related accumulation of DNA damage) [ 68 ] genomic instabilities [ 69 – 71 ]. Importantly, these responses, collectively termed radioadaptive responses or radiation hormesis, may protect against spontaneous or induced cancer [ 72 ]. Since radiation-induced tumorigenesis is a major risk concomitant with long-distance space travel, radiation hormesis has posed serious questions on the adequacy and scientific justification of the international radiation protection standards [ 70 ]. They dictate that any, however small, exposure to ionizing radiation leads to a proportional increase in cancer risk, thus postulating that there are no safe levels of radiation exposure. This system is based on the Linear-No-Threshold model that extrapolates human atomic bomb survival data obtained for high-to-low doses [ 73 ]. It appears that low-dose radiation-induced protective mechanisms are not specific to a certain molecular or cellular pathway and cover a broad range of cell-autonomous (DNA repair, anti-oxidant, pro-survival gene activation) and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms (immune system activation, bystander effects, etc.). In relation to space, it is important to understand how radioadaptive responses can be elicited upon exposure to high LET radiation types. Early radioadaptive response studies failed to demonstrate beneficial biological responses upon exposure to low doses of high LET radiation [ 74 ]. However, more recently such a possibility has been demonstrated using human cell lines. Not only low-dose X-ray exposure was shown to trigger better DNA repair and cause lower mutation frequencies in response to high doses of high-LET ion irradiation [ 75 ], but also low doses of high-LET irradiation were reported to produce radiation adaptive responses upon high doses of the same high-LET irradiation [ 76 ]. Rithidech and Scott [ 77 ] proposed that the protective mechanisms could be triggered in cells by a gamma-component that is produced within a body upon exposure to neutrons [ 78 ]. Additionally, it has been shown that low doses of low LET radiation may render resistance to genotoxicity and teratogenesis induced by high doses of HZE particles [ 75 , 79 ]. Intriguingly, priming normal human cells with low doses of energetic protons resulted in lower chromosomal damage induced by subsequent exposure to iron ions [ 80 ]. All of these scenarios are relevant to radiation exposures experienced by human astronauts onboard of a spacecraft, making it thus conceivable that cells and tissues may be made resistant to detrimental effects of GSR by priming or ongoing exposures to low LET radiation. Genome instability resulting from DNA damage and mutation in both nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA caused by replication errors and exposure to endogenous and exogenous mutagens has long been implicated as one of the main causes of aging [ 81 – 86 ]. All of the above strategies for enhancing radioresistance in humans, from the expression and overexpression of exogenous and endogenous DNA repair genes, antioxidants and ROS scavengers, to the expression of exogenous radioprotective genes (e.g. Dsup), would also ancillarily serve as a means of attenuating DNA damage and mutation caused by exposure to the many endogenous and exogenous mutagens, foremost among these being endogenous ROS produced via normative cellular respiration, that are implicated in eukaryotic aging. As such, the above strategies for enhancing radioresistance in humans would also constitute a promising geroprotective strategy and a means of attenuating aging and promoting longevity and extension of both lifespan and healthspan in humans as well. In addition to the direct effect of radiation on the target cells, a so-called bystander effect has been described where nearby, but unirradiated, cells activate their DNA damage response [ 87 , 88 ]. These non-targeted effects are underlain by various mechanisms, for instance, at a systemic level via the microenvironment and TGF-beta signaling [ 89 ], via extracellular vesicles (EV), natural nanoparticles secreted by different cells and carrying protein markers, peptides, mRNA, microRNA (miRNA), non-coding RNA (ncRNA), DNA, and retrotransposon elements involved in cell-cell communication. Recently miRNAs have been shown to play an important role in radiation induced bystander effects [ 90 ]. Not only can miRNAs be contained in EV, but also can be free floating throughout the circulation. One study has shown that these circulating miRNAs contribute to non-targeted effects by traveling between irradiated and nonirradiated cells and increase the cells radioresistance [ 91 ]. In some studies, specific EV are secreted after irradiation, in particular, after radiation therapy. Experiments on cell cultures have demonstrated that EV and probably mRNA present in these EV mediate the development of the bystander effect [ 92 – 94 ]. In addition, a direct correlation between the amount of EV and irradiation dose has been demonstrated [ 95 ]. In experiments performed by Jella KK et al., exosomes (particles sized 30-100 nm) and microvesicles (>100 nm) were isolated after cell exposure to radiation in different doses and their concentration depended on the irradiation dose [ 93 ]. In vitro experiments have shown that radiation-induced EV are easily absorbed by cells during co-culturing and due to some modifications in their molecular composition promote cell migration by enhancing activation of TrkA and FAK signaling. At the organism level, EV act as long-distance transport modules capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier [ 96 ]. EV also play an important role in the development of tumor process. Specific EV were isolated for human breast epithelial cancer, prostatic cancer, glioblastoma, pancreatic cancer, melanoma, and stomach cancer [ 92 , 97 – 100 ]. When evaluating the effect of space flight factors, quantitative and qualitative characteristics of microparticles produced by different cells under normal and pathological conditions should be taken into account, as they considerably influence the development of genetic instability, apoptosis, and tumor process. They can provide valuable information about the pathological process and serve as markers of the corresponding diseases.","MAJOR HEALTH THREAT FROM COSMIC RADIATION Injury to the central nervous system Space flight conditions (SFC) significantly affect the operating activity of astronauts during deep space missions [ 101 – 103 ]. Ionizing radiation, especially GCR creates a risk for the normal functioning of the central nervous system, with acute and chronic exposure leading to alterations in the cognitive abilities, reduction of motor functions and behavioral changes [ 104 ]. In contrast to orbital flights, leaving the Earth's magnetic field drastically increases the exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) and, above all, high-energy nuclei component of cosmic rays (HZE). Thus, during a 3-year-long mission to Mars, 13% of neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) will be permeated at least once by an iron ion, while at the same time, ~ 50% of neurons in the hippocampus will be permeated by charged particles with an atomic number greater than 15 [ 105 ]. There are a lot of disparate data about the detrimental effects of the SFC onto the cognitive abilities, and on the mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative disorders [ 106 , 107 ]. To date, the neurochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying the cognitive impairments resulting from the effects of SFC are not clearly understood; even information about the potential risks for the CNS is contradictory [ 108 , 109 ]. The most harmful component of GCR is the HZE particles, e.g. 56Fe. In rodent models, exposure to even small doses of 56Fe ions, was shown to induce pronounced deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. In particular, a sharp decrease in spatial memory and orientation in the Morris water maze and Barnes maze were observed after exposure to 56Fe ions in doses 0.1-1 Gy [ 110 ] [ 111 ] [ 112 ] [ 113 ] [ 114 ]. Current estimates place the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for 1 GeV/u 56Fe particle-induced hippocampal memory impairment at around 50 [ 110 ]. Acute exposures of 48Ti ions in doses 0.02-0.2 Gy (1 Gev/n) significantly reduced the mean spatial memory of the rats at three months after exposure, and significantly increased the percentage of rats with severe impairment, which manifested itself in subpar performance [ 115 ]. Indeed, 7, 11 and even 15 months following exposure to 56Fe ions in doses 1-2 Gy, the irradiated groups fared significantly worse on the ascending fixed-ratio operant task (bar pressing for food reward) than the controls. Rats exposed to proton doses of less than 3 Gy suffered disturbances in conditioned taste aversion 3 days following exposure [ 116 ] while doses of 3-4 Gy produced transient direct deficits in open field exploratory behaviour, acoustic startle habituation and rotarod performance in mice [ 117 ]. In a rat model, irradiation with high-energy protons in doses of 1-2 Gy induced a decrease in the efficacy of test performance in T-maze. The treatment caused a decrease in the concentration of catecholamines in the prefrontal cortex and 3-MT, a metabolite of dopamine, in striatum [ 118 ]. Exposure to 1 Gy of 12C ions drastically reduced the content of 3-MT, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and serotonin in the prefrontal cortex of rats [ 119 ]. This indicates that the prefrontal cortex is the most sensitive area of the brain in terms of the deleterious effects of HZE on the content of monoamines. Worth mentioning, the changes in the content of neurotransmitters regions rich in dopaminergic neurons, directly affect the emotional and motivational behavior, attention, spatial learning and contextual memory [ 120 ] [ 121 ] [ 122 ]. Finally, HZE can induce the strong disturbances in the CNS, especially in spatial memory and orientation. These disturbances may be critical for performance of astronauts in deep space missions. The non-radiation SFC, especially microgravity, can significantly change the effect of IR injury. Surprisingly, the SFC applied in combination may antagonize each other, for instance, IR eliminated the cognitive deficits occurring in response to the AS. The need for future experiments to further investigate this effect and its mechanisms is evident. Cardiovascular diseases The impact of prolonged exposure to microgravity on cardiovascular system has been well characterized. Tachycardia, baroreflex dysfunction, and reduced physical capacity were observed in experimental animals as soon as in 14 days after microgravity modeling [ 123 ]; [ 124 ]. Similar changes were observed in humans under conditions of modeled microgravity or after space missions [ 125 ]. Long-term sympathovagal imbalance increases the risk of fatal arrhythmias [ 126 ] and is the negative risk factor in cardiovascular disturbances and strokes [ 127 ] [ 128 ]. In astronauts, arrhythmia episodes were recorded during performance under stress [ 129 ]. NASA has recently reported increased cardiovascular mortality among lunar astronauts [ 130 ]. The authors attribute the observed phenomenon to the effect of lunar radiation on the endothelium. However, a recent report by Cucinotta et al suggests that such conclusions should be revisited due to methodological deficiencies in the analyses by Delp et al. and that circulatory disease due to space radiation does not contribute to mortality in astronauts [ 131 ]. Immune effects Given that the organs of the immune system, including bone marrow and lymph nodes are some of the most radiation-sensitive tissues in the human body [ 17 ], it is of little wonder that abnormalities in the functioning of the immune system have been observed in astronauts as early as the 1970s [ 132 ]. In this regard, a depressed immune system in astronauts can potentially increase the incidence of infection, acute and chronic inflammation, and potentially carcinogenesis, while an enhanced immune response is associated with allergies and autoimmune diseases [ 133 ] [ 134 ]. Therefore, in combination with the greater virulence of pathogens in space [ 135 ], immune system dysfunction is of major concern for the expansion of human presence beyond Earth's orbit [ 136 ]. The human data on the precise impact of cosmic radiation on the immune system is lacking, mostly due to the fact that there have not been enough manned missions outside of the Earth's magnetic field. In vitro investigations show that the d0 (the mean lethal dose) values for various lymphocyte lineages range from 0.25-0.35 Gy [ 137 ]; by comparison, an average for mammalian oxygenated cells is around 1.5 Gy. Simulated cosmic radiation experiments performed on lymphocytes also indicate extensive chromosomal exchanges as a result of irradiation, the impact of which can be somewhat mitigated by shielding [ 138 ]. Data from animal model experiments performed on Earth is in accord with the above: in a rat experiment, whole-body 1 Gy irradiation produced an acute decrease in the concentration of circulating lymphocytes [ 139 ]. Subsequent experiments simulating galactic cosmic irradiation and solar particle events on mice demonstrated both chronic and acute deleterious effects on lymphocyte populations, functioning and chromosomal stability, with circulating B lymphocytes being the most affected, followed by T-cells and natural killer cells (reviewed in [ 17 ] and also in [ 140 ]). In the context of radioprotection, previous studies investigated whether pre-exposure to radiation might have an impact on an individual's radiation sensitivity of the immune system. So far, different studies gave contradictory results [ 141 ] [ 142 ] [ 143 ] [ 144 ]. Therefore it is worthwhile to further investigate whether pre-exposure to low-dose radiation may offer some degree of radioprotection. Cancer and aging The concept of DNA being the main target of ionizing radiation, combined with the classical views of molecular biology that DNA mutations are the main initiating and propagating events driving cellular neoplastic transformation and carcinogenesis [ 145 ], has led to the acceptance of the risk of fatal cancer as the major health risk of exposure to radiation [ 21 ]. Predicting such risks and their management is implemented in the current international radiological protection system that is comprised of a number of international and national advisory (e.g. ICRP, UNSCEAR) and regulatory bodies (e.g. NCRP, NIOSH, CNSC). Their cancer risk models and guidelines are predominantly based on the findings of the epidemiological life span study of atomic bomb survivors in Japan [ 146 ]. Although the exposure doses in those human cohorts were high, the derived relationship between dose and cancer is extrapolated back to low doses to calculate cancer risks encountered upon environmental or occupational exposure to low doses. This is accomplished with the help of a dose and dose rate effectiveness factor – accounting for sparing of the effect of chronic low-dose exposures – and a radiation quality factor that is based on relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of a particular radiation type and is linked to a LET value. Since high-LET particles – known for their high RBE - are a substantial component of cosmic radiation, fatal cancer risks associated with space missions are an obvious and a serious concern and limits space mission length. Cancer and aging are intricately related [ 147 ]. Indeed, aging, as a factor, is the largest contributor to cancer [ 147 , 148 ]. A global view of how age affects the host was recently discussed by López-Otin et al. [ 85 ] categorizing nine “hallmarks of aging” in the host, but minimal evidence was included towards the direct impact of these hallmarks on cancer progression. Molecular factors involved in the hallmarks of aging are impacted by the individual organs, which are usually not considered a factor in carcinogenesis unless discussing the immediate tumor microenvironment [ 149 ]. Changes with the immune system as a function of age stemming from the spleen have potential to affect cancer risk and tumor progression [ 150 ]. Limited research exists on cancer risk as a function of age and sex for the interplay between organs. Astronauts typically have an age range of 35-55 years old [ 151 ] providing potential biological differences in the host as a function of age that can impact tumor progression. Age and sex are typically studied together obscuring the effects of a central determinant on overall cancer risk. Understanding how systemic host change as a function of age and HZE irradiation will greatly improve cancer risk models for space travel. In mice, genetic modifications that cause increases in lifespan are also able to concurrently reduce cancer rates [ 152 ] and vice versa [ 153 ]. Taken together, the model of aging-related accumulation of mutations (Lopez-Otin, 2013) and the multistep mutational theory of carcinogenesis [ 154 ] explain well such a strong connection. Although somewhat simplistic and not capable to explain some experimental observations (e.g. leveling off of cancer incidence at advanced age), this explanation may be useful for predicting cancer risks upon exposure to radiation since many observations related to aging can be used to draw connections to cancer. For example, disruption of DNA repair or DNA damage response pathways are frequently observed in both aging and cancer phenotypes [ 155 , 156 ]. Since epidemiological studies of cancer incidence among astronauts are not practical due to low group size and associated low statistical power, terrestrial studies examining HZE particles-induced changes in various endpoints related to cancer and aging are of primary importance for improving cancer risk models for cosmic radiation exposures. Modeling cosmic radiation on Earth is extremely difficult due to its very complex particle spectrum and the presence of very high energy nuclei. However, various laboratories built around large nuclear facilities, such as accelerators, have used heavy ions of 56 Fe, C, He, protons, and some others for studying the effects of HZE particles on a range biological endpoints, such as cancer, systematic response to radiation induced cancer, and DNA damage in both animal and cell culture models [ 157 ]. In vitro or ex vivo studies offer greater opportunities for detailed characterization of RBE as a function of LET for various endpoints related to carcinogenesis, such as chromosomal aberrations, mutations and neoplastic transformation when compared to in vivo studies, but are harder to relate the impact on aging. RBE of HZE particles for induction of neoplastic transformation in mouse C3H10T1/2 cells varied between 2 and 10 depending on the LET value of a particular heavy ion [ 158 ]. These RBE values may have been underestimated due to the use of X-rays instead of γ-rays as a reference radiation and the use of readouts at 50% cell survival levels. Using chromosomal aberration induction in human peripheral blood lymphocytes exposed ex vivo to various heavy ions, RBE values of 10 and 30 were produced for cycling and interphase cells, respectively [ 159 , 160 ]. Interestingly, these studies independently revealed a similar pattern of RBE dependence on LET by using varying energies of Si nuclei [ 160 ] or different nuclei [ 158 ], with the maximum RBE observed at around 100 keV/μm. Similar RBE were shown for HPRT mutations [ 161 ]. Although very limited in number, animal studies in general show substantially higher cancer rates when compared to low-LET radiation exposures. Thus, HZE irradiation was 20-40 times more effective in inducing Harderian gland tumors in mice compared to low-LET irradiation [ 39 , 162 ]. This effectiveness was even increased when a single acute dose was split into several fractions, indicating that the attenuation effect seen for low-LET radiation at low dose rate exposures is not present for HZE nuclei [ 163 , 164 ]. Similar RBE estimates were obtained for skin and mammary tumors in rats exposed to Fe nuclei; however, no changes upon fractionation were found in RBE values [ 165 – 167 ]. Interestingly, Fe particles induced acute myeloid leukemia with the same efficiency as 137Cs γ-rays [ 162 ], consistent with α-particle results in mice [ 168 ] and the thorotrast patients study [ 169 ]. More recently, Miousse et al. [ 170 ] showed that epigenetic alterations related to genomic DNA methylation, rather that accumulation of DNA damage, were observed in bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells of mice exposed to 56Fe heavy ions. With respect to aging, irradiation of fish embryos with 56Fe particles, but not γ-rays, lead to increased levels of lipid peroxidation products and other oxidative metabolism pathology, suggesting a higher potential of HZE ions to affect aging when compared to low-LET radiation [ 171 ]. Lastly, studies of peripheral blood lymphocytes from human astronauts flown on various length International Space Station missions showed increased levels of chromosome aberrations [ 172 ] and their stability over time indicating higher complexity and carcinogenic potential [ 173 ]. Overall, in vivo results are consistent with in vitro studies and confirm substantially higher capacity of the HZE component of cosmic radiation to trigger cancer-related changes compared to low-LET radiation. In addition, to the factors mentioned above recently miRNAs have been implicated in cancer risk and space radiation. MicroRNAs (small non-coding RNA molecules with a negative and post-transcriptional regulation on gene expression) have recently been implicated in age, sex, radiation, and radiation bystander effects. It is known that each miRNA can target hundreds of mRNAs, which predicts that over half of the existing human transcriptome is regulated by miRNAs [ 174 , 175 ]. A bystander response to low-LET radiation has been shown to have a sex-specific deregulation on miRNA signature in non-exposed spleens [ 176 ]. Evidence also suggests a tissue-specific coordinated pool of miRNAs contribute to the “hallmarks of aging” [ 177 ]. These pools of miRNAs are also shown to impact both innate and adaptive immune responses, which can be altered by cytokine stimulation from such factors as TGFβ1 [ 174 , 175 , 177 ]. Recent studies have also started to show the importance of certain miRNA signatures driving cancer progression [ 178 – 181 ]. Studies involving low-LET radiation have demonstrated specific miRNA radiation-dependent signatures [ 182 ], but little is known on the potential impact of miRNA and HZE irradiation. Overlap exists between the miRNA signatures in various cancers, age related miRNAs, and miRNAs associated with low-LET radiation, but little is reported on how all these factors uniformly impact cancer progression and effect cancer risk due to space radiation. Further, the impact of where and how the miRNAs affecting these factors (i.e. non-tumor related organs) is not understood. Although cosmic radiation risks include cataracts, circulatory disease, damage to CNS and others, risks of fatal cancer is the major component and contributor to overall radiation health risks that are being estimated and used for operation and planning of human space missions [ 183 ]. Due to the inherent paucity of human data on the space radiation effects on cancer and aging, and difficulties in recreating space radiation fields in the ground-based research studies to better characterize biological effectiveness of such radiation for cancer and aging related endpoints, current health risk estimates carry large uncertainties. It is therefore anticipated that cancer and aging will continue to play a dominant role in future studies to a) minimize the uncertainties to improve health risk management, b) to identify individual factors affecting radiation sensitivity and c) to generate sufficient knowledge for implementing various biotechnological countermeasures described in the next section.",Vive la radior√©sistance!: Converging research in radiobiology and biogerontology to enhance human radioresistance for deep space exploration and colonization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5865701/,

While little is known about how spaceflight affects transcription spatially in the brain, a greater understanding of this process has the potential to aid strategies that mitigate the effects of spaceflight on the brain. Therefore, we performed GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling of mouse brains subjected to either spaceflight or grounded controls. Four brain regions were selected: Cortex, Frontal Cortex, Corunu Ammonis I, and Dentate Gyrus. Antioxidants have emerged as a potential means of attenuating the effects of spaceflight, so we treated a subset of the mice with a superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE). Our analysis revealed hundreds of differentially expressed genes due to spaceflight in each of the four brain regions. Both common and region-specific transcriptomic responses were observed. Metabolic pathways and pathways sensitive to oxidative stress were enriched in the four brain regions due to spaceflight. These findings enhance our understanding of brain regional variation in susceptibility to spaceflight conditions. BuOE reduced the transcriptomic effects of spaceflight at a large number of genes, suggesting that this compound may attenuate oxidative stress-induced brain damage caused by the spaceflight environment.",1.

In the current study, we show that both basal defense and systemic acquired resistance responses are affected in transgenic plants constitutively expressing the human type I inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (InsP 5-ptase) which have greatly reduced InsP 3 levels. Flagellin induced Ca 2+ -release as well as the expressions of some flg22 responsive genes were attenuated in the InsP 5-ptase plants. Furthermore, the InsP 5-ptase plants were more susceptible to virulent and avirulent strains of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato ( Pst ) DC3000 . The InsP 5-ptase plants had lower basal salicylic acid (SA) levels and the induction of SAR in systemic leaves was reduced and delayed. Reciprocal exudate experiments showed that although the InsP 5-ptase plants produced equally effective molecules that could trigger PR-1 gene expression in wild type plants, exudates collected from either wild type or InsP 5-ptase plants triggered less PR-1 gene expression in InsP 5-ptase plants. Additionally, expression profiles indicated that several defense genes including PR-1 , PR-2 , PR-5 , and AIG1 were basally down regulated in the InsP 5-ptase plants compared with wild type. Upon pathogen attack, expression of these genes was either not induced or showed delayed induction in systemic leaves. Our study shows that phosphoinositide signaling is one component of the plant defense network and is involved in both basal and systemic responses. The dampening of InsP 3 -mediated signaling affects Ca 2+ release, modulates defense gene expression and compromises plant defense responses.",Introduction,Materials and methods,Results,Discussion,"Discussion A summary of our major results is illustrated in Figure 6 . In the InsP 5-ptase plants, PTI responses including MAMP-triggered Ca 2+ increase and gene expression were affected, although ROS generation was normal. Additionally, ETI responses occurring at the local infected leaves were compromised in InsP 5-ptase plants leading to a reduced and delayed induction of the systemic response. Figure 6 Summary of InsP 5-ptase plants responses to flg22 and Pseudomonas syringae . The major results described in the paper are listed. The transport of mobile signals from local to distal leaves was not investigated and is indicated by the “?.” PTI, PAMP triggered immunity; ETI, Effector triggered immunity; SA, salicylic acid; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SAR, systemic acquired resistance. A reduction in basal InsP 3 levels is the most dramatic and direct consequence of the constitutive expression of InsP 5-ptase in the InsP 5-ptase transgenic Arabidopsis plants (Perera et al., 2006 , 2008 ). It is reasonable to speculate therefore, that the inability to propagate an InsP 3 signal is the primary basis for the altered defense responses exhibited by these plants. However, we cannot rule out potential up and downstream effects of the increased turnover of InsP 3 , since InsP 3 is an intermediate in the phosphoinositide pathway and is linked to both the phospholipids and the inositol phosphates. In previous work, we showed that PIP5K activity and PtdInsP 2 synthesis was upregulated in transgenic tobacco cells in suspension culture expressing InsP 5-ptase (Perera et al., 2002 ). Under normal growth conditions, in our hands, we have not detected a up regulation of PtdInsP 2 synthesis in transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings or plants. It is possible that the InsP 5-ptase plants have altered localized perturbations in membrane phospholipids under specific conditions (such as hydroponic growth, König et al., 2007 ) or in response to stimuli such as pathogens. InsP 3 signaling in plants remains a controversial topic primarily due to the fact that at a molecular level, an InsP 3 responsive Ca 2+ channel (analogous to the animal InsP 3 receptor) has not been identified in plant genomes (discussed in Krinke et al., 2007a ; Munnik and Nielsen, 2011 ). Nevertheless, many studies have demonstrated that InsP 3 is a physiological ligand (reviewed in Krinke et al., 2007a ; Dodd et al., 2010 ; Pokotylo et al., 2014 ) and InsP 3 changes occur rapidly and transiently in response to wide variety of both abiotic and biotic signals/stimuli (reviewed in Krinke et al., 2007a ; Im et al., 2010 ). It has also been suggested that InsP 6 rather than InsP 3 is the ligand responsible for Ca 2+ release from intracellular plant stores (Lemtiri-Chlieh et al., 2003 ). Since InsP 3 is an intermediate in the lipid-dependent route of InsP 6 biosynthesis (reviewed in Gillaspy, 2011 , 2013 ), increased InsP 3 turnover could be expected to affect InsP 6 levels and indeed the InsP 5-ptase plants have lower InsP 6 levels compared to wild type (Perera et al., 2008 ). Increased susceptibility to several microbial pathogens was reported in low InsP 6 mutants (Murphy et al., 2008 ). However, (unlike the InsP 5-ptase plants), these mutants had normal basal levels of SA and normal SA induction upon infection. Therefore we cannot attribute all of the attenuated defense responses of the InsP 5-ptase plants to a decrease in InsP 6 . Other inositol phosphate intermediates, including InsP 4 and InsP 5 are implicated in stress responses (reviewed in Pokotylo et al., 2014 ). It is conceivable that InsP 6 (and/or other inositol phosphates) act synergistically with InsP 3 to mediate signaling leading to defense responses. Attenuation of Ca 2+ signals It is clear that both PTI and ETI share similar signal transduction components and downstream targets (discussed in Ma and Berkowitz, 2007 ; Tsuda and Katagiri, 2010 ) and may represent an overlapping and interconnected network. The complexity of this signaling network is illustrated by the convergence and crosstalk between parallel branches (Boudsocq and Sheen, 2013 ). A rise in cytosolic Ca 2+ is one common signaling element in response to both PTI and ETI and Ca 2+ may be a primary signal essential for initiating many of the early events; however there are differences in the timing and duration of the PTI and ETI associated Ca 2+ signals. Additionally there are feedback loops that modulate the propagation of the Ca 2+ signal (Ma and Berkowitz, 2007 , 2011 ). We showed that the InsP 5-ptase seedlings have a greatly attenuated Ca 2+ signal in response to flg22 compared to wild type (Figure 1B ). A similar result was reported using intact leaves exposed to flg22 (Ma et al., 2012 ). Intriguingly, the InsP 5-ptase plants exhibited a normal Ca 2+ response to the plant derived peptide elicitor Pep3 (Ma et al., 2012 ). The Pep receptor PEPR is linked to the cyclic nucleotide gated cation channel CNGC2 (Qi et al., 2010 ; Ma et al., 2012 ). Interestingly, the cngc2 mutant showed an opposite Ca 2+ response to the InsP 5-ptase plants; an attenuated Ca 2+ rise in response to Pep3 but a normal Ca 2+ response to flg22 (Ma et al., 2012 ). This result supports the involvement of different pathways of Ca 2+ influx in response to Pep and flg22. It was suggested that Pep primarily targets extracellular stores (via influx by CNGC2) while flg22 may involve an additional contribution from intracellular stores. Detailed studies of the amplitude and kinetics of flg22 dose-dependent Ca 2+ changes also suggested that two processes or two different stores may be involved in the flg22 induced Ca 2+ response (Jeworutzki et al., 2010 ; Ranf et al., 2011 ). A biphasic Ca 2+ response was previously reported in response to avirulent pathogens (Grant et al., 2000 ). Ma and Berkowitz ( 2007 ) proposed that the initial pathogen-associated Ca 2+ rise is primarily via influx from the apoplast while the subsequent Ca 2+ rise is from intracellular stores. We observed that while the initial Ca 2+ peak was similar to wild type, the timing of the second Ca 2+ peak was delayed in the InsP 5-ptase plants (Figure 3B ) which supports a role for InsP 3 in sustaining and propagating the pathogen-associated cytosolic Ca 2+ signal. Our results are consistent with a model in which InsP 3 (and or its derivatives) may act in an intracellular Ca 2+ relay which would be downstream of the initial Ca 2+ influx from the apoplast. Because MAMP-triggered ROS was unaffected in the InsP 5-ptase plants we propose that the initial rise in cytosolic Ca 2+ in response to MAMP elicitation may activate some downstream targets (such as CDPKs) as well as trigger the early oxidative burst. Alternatively, the ROS response may be “primed” by BIK1 in a parallel Ca 2+ independent manner (Kadota et al., 2014 ; Li et al., 2014 ). In plants several intracellular compartments serve as Ca 2+ stores (reviewed in Dodd et al., 2010 ). The InsP 3 responsive Ca 2+ store is likely to be the ER or vacuole; however we cannot rule out the involvement of the chloroplast (Manzoor et al., 2012 ). A plant specific Ca 2+ sensor protein CAS, which is located in the chloroplasts, was recently shown to play a role in both PTI and ETI (Nomura et al., 2012 ). There are shared similarities in the response of the cas-1 mutant and the InsP 5-ptase transgenic plants in defense signaling, such as increased susceptibility to both virulent and avirulent bacterial strains, basally reduced PR-1 gene expression and normal ROS generation in response to flg22. However at present, we have no information on whether InsP 3 (and/or InsP 6 ) may affect Ca 2+ stores in the chloroplast. The basal down regulation of PR genes and the reduced activation of PR gene expression in the InsP 5-ptase plants may also reflect alterations in ER Ca 2+ homeostasis as discussed further below. SA biosynthesis and SA mediated signaling InsP 5-ptase plants have low basal SA (under normal control conditions) and when infected with avirulent pathogens, SA levels were lower than wild type plants at day 2 post inoculation (Figure 4 ), suggesting that SA biosynthesis maybe reduced in the transgenic plants. The reduced levels of SA in InsP 5-ptase plants suggest a link between PI-metabolism and SA accumulation/pathway through a yet unknown mechanism that ultimately affects plant defense, either directly or indirectly. At a transcriptional level, based on previous microarray results (Perera et al., 2008 ), we have not detected lower expression of the two key genes involved in SA biosynthesis, namely phenylalanine ammonia lyase ( PAL ) and isochorismate synthase ( ICS1 ), (Wildermuth et al., 2001 ). ABA has been implicated as a negative regulator of SA due to their overlapping biosynthetic pathways (de Torres Zabala et al., 2009 ; reviewed in Cao et al., 2011 ). However, we did not detect increased basal ABA levels in InsP 5-ptase plants (Perera et al., 2008 ). Another possibility is that expression of genes encoding positive regulators of SA accumulation (reviewed in Lu, 2009 ; Ng et al., 2011 ), could be impaired in InsP 5-ptase plants, resulting in lowered SA levels. One of these genes is PAD4 , which showed a delayed induction in systemic leaves (Table 2 ). Similar to InsP 5-ptase plants, mutants of this group of genes have reduced SA accumulation and enhanced susceptibility to pathogens which could be rescued by exogenous SA treatment (Zhou et al., 1998 ). Recent studies also point to the involvement of Ca 2+ /calmodulin (CaM) in modulating SA biosynthesis. SARD1 and CBP60g, are two related transcription factors which control SA biosynthesis by regulating ICS1 expression. Interestingly, CBP60g is a calmodulin-binding protein and its activity is Ca 2+ -dependent (Zhang et al., 2010 ; Truman and Glazebrook, 2012 ). It is possible that the reduced Ca 2+ response in InsP 5-ptase plants might affect induction and accumulation of SA via CBP60g activity. Attenuated gene expression We have reported that select early flg22 responsive genes showed reduced expression at 120 min in the InsP 5-ptase plants (Figure 1E ). We suspect that some downstream transcriptional responses may require the continued propagation of the Ca 2+ signal. We have also shown that the InsP 5-ptase plants have basally reduced levels of some defense-related genes (Table 1 ). Additionally, induction of PR-1 was delayed in local leaves and several SAR related genes were either not induced or delayed in induction in systemic leaves (Figure 2D , Table 2 ). We suggest that these genes are in part under the control of SA and Ca 2+ /CaM which can regulate transcription by either directly or indirectly interacting with transcription factors (review Dong, 2004 ; Kim et al., 2009 ; Reddy et al., 2011 ). The DNA-binding activity of the transcription factor CAMTA (or SR) is enhanced by Ca 2+ /CaM binding (review, Finkler et al., 2007 ). Arabidopsis CAMTA3 acts as a negative regulator of biotic stress responses. The loss-of-function mutants have elevated levels of SA and exhibit enhanced disease resistance. Additionally, several defense-associated genes (including PR genes) are found to be up-regulated in camta3 mutants (Galon et al., 2008 ; Du et al., 2009 ). The cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (CNGC) mutant cngc2 also shows constitutively high PR-1 gene expression and high SA production (Chan et al., 2008 ). The phenotypes of both the camta3 and cngc2 mutants are opposite to what we observed in the InsP 5-ptase plants, which have low PR-1 gene expression and low SA levels. We have noted a striking inverse correlation between genes that are basally down regulated in the InsP 5-ptase plants and genes that are upregulated in camta3 and cngc2 (Supplementary Table 4 ). Twelve of the basally upregulated genes in cngc2 , and thirteen of the upregulated genes in camta3 were found downregulated in InsP 5-ptase plants (Perera et al., 2008 ) including PR-1 , PR-2 , and PR-5 (Supplementary Table 4 ). Furthermore, there was strong overlap between this subset of genes and the top 50 candidates in the PR-1 coexpression network as well as with genes that upregulated in wild type seedlings grown under high Ca 2+ conditions (Chan et al., 2008 ). These results are further support for Ca 2+ mediated regulation of gene expression although at present, the exact mechanism of activation of these over lapping genes is not known. SA is also implicated in the regulation of PR gene expression via the activation of the TGA (TGACG Motif-Binding Factor) transcription factors (review, Dong, 2004 ; Fu and Dong, 2013 ). Accumulation of SA affects the cellular redox and controls the translocation of the cofactor NPR1 into the nucleus where it binds and activates TGAs. Most TGAs act as positive regulators to induce PR genes as well as the expression of genes encoding ER resident proteins involved in protein folding and Ca 2+ storage. The induction of the protein secretory pathway is required for SAR (Wang et al., 2005 ). InsP 5-ptase plants have low basal levels of PR-1 , PR -5, CRT3 , and BiP3 (Table 1 ), which may be in part due to low basal SA and/or low ER Ca 2+ . In conclusion, we show that the constitutive expression of InsP 5-ptase affects Ca 2+ release, expression of a subset of defense related genes and both basal and SAR responses but does not affect ROS production. We favor the model postulated by Ranf et al. ( 2011 ) in which Ca 2+ acts as an “on/off switch” and a threshold level of Ca 2+ is required for full activation of the downstream pathways. The InsP 5-ptase plants are impaired in their ability to propagate and maintain the Ca 2+ signal and therefore are unable to mount a full and robust defense response.",Supplementary material The Supplementary Material for this article can be found online at: http://www.frontiersin.org/journal/10.3389/fpls.2014.00267/abstract Click here for additional data file.,Phosphoinositide-signaling is one component of a robust plant defense response,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4052902/,

Several spaceflight experiments have focused on transcriptional profiling as a means of understanding plant adaptation to microgravity. However, there is limited overlap between results from different experiments. Differences in experimental conditions and hardware make it difficult to find a consistent response across experiments and to distinguish the primary effects of microgravity from other spaceflight effects. Methods Plant Signaling (PS) and Plant RNA Regulation (PRR) were two separate spaceflight experiments conducted on the International Space Station utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS). The EMCS provided a lighted environment for plant growth with centrifugal capabilities providing an onboard 1 g control. Results and discussion An RNA-Seq analysis of shoot samples from PS and PRR revealed a significant overlap of genes differentially expressed in microgravity between the two experiments. Relative to onboard 1 g controls, genes involved in transcriptional regulation, shoot development, and response to auxin and light were upregulated in microgravity in both experiments. Conversely, genes involved in defense response, abiotic stress, Ca ++ signaling, and cell wall modification were commonly downregulated in both datasets. The downregulation of stress responses in microgravity in these two experiments is interesting as these pathways have been previously observed as upregulated in spaceflight compared to ground controls. Similarly, we have observed many stress response genes to be upregulated in the 1 g onboard control compared to ground reference controls; however these genes were specifically downregulated in microgravity. In addition, we analyzed the sRNA landscape of the 1 g and microgravity (μ g ) shoot samples from PRR. We identified three miRNAs (miR319c, miR398b, and miR8683) which were upregulated in microgravity, while several of their corresponding target genes were found to be downregulated in microgravity. Interestingly, the downregulated target genes are enriched in those encoding chloroplast-localized enzymes and proteins. These results uncover microgravity unique transcriptional changes and highlight the validity and importance of an onboard 1 g control.",Introduction,Methods,Results and discussion,Results and discussion,"4 Discussion 4.1 Conserved and unique transcriptional changes in microgravity The PS and PRR spaceflight experiments were designed to examine early seedling development and responses to microgravity. To answer these questions, we utilized the EMCS facility with a rotor configuration selected to provide µ g and an onboard 1 g control. The two experiments were conducted at different times and had different lighting regimes as well as some other differences in set up as outlined in Figure 1 . Despite these differences, there was considerable parity between the DEGs in µ g between the two experiments. Genes upregulated in µ g compared to the 1 g control were primarily involved in leaf and shoot development. The majority of the upregulated TFs function to regulate these processes and the enrichment in auxin and vesicle transport also support growth processes. In contrast, there appears to be a substantial downregulation of both biotic and abiotic stress responses in µ g . Defense related genes were overrepresented and most of the downregulated TFs function in mediating plant stress responses ( Figure 4 ). Additionally, we identified specific miRNAs that were differentially regulated in microgravity with coordinate regulation of their putative targets. The large-scale downregulation in microgravity of stress-response related genes in the PS and PRR flight experiments are somewhat at odds with other experiments where flight responses are compared to a ground control on Earth. In fact, we find that genes reported as upregulated in spaceflight appear to be downregulated in our datasets. For instance, 70 genes that were upregulated in spaceflight in BRIC19 ( Choi et al., 2019 ) are downregulated in µ g in our dataset. Many of these common genes are associated with response to stress and hypoxia. We do however find more overlap in responses if we examine RNA-Seq datasets from other EMCS spaceflight experiments which utilized onboard 1 g controls. The Seedling Growth experiments (SG2 and SG3) were conducted in the EMCS; however these experiments included photostimulation with either unidirectional blue ( Herranz et al., 2019 ; Vandenbrink et al., 2019 ) or red ( Villacampa et al., 2021 ) light for the final 48h of the experimental timeline. Although there was almost no overlap in DEGs upregulated in µ g ; we do detect considerable overlap with µ g downregulated genes as well as genes downregulated in low (<0.1) g ( Herranz et al., 2019 ). Comparing our results to Herranz et al. shows that 54 genes were commonly downregulated in µ g . Furthermore, 143 genes downregulated in low g were shared with genes downregulated in µ g in our data. Even more pronounced is the similarity in enriched GO terms for genes downregulated in µ g and low g compared to 1 g ( Herranz et al., 2019 ) and the genes downregulated in µ g in the PS/PRR data. These include, response to stimulus, response to abiotic stimulus and response to stress. Genes downregulated in µ g in with the red light photostimulation ( Villacampa et al., 2021 ) were enriched in the GO categories response to bacterium and fungus. Taken together these results further reinforce the idea that both biotic and abiotic stress responses appear to be specifically downregulated in µ g . This regulation would not have been detected without the onboard 1 g condition for comparison and these results point to the value of having an onboard 1 g control. At least 4 different Arabidopsis ecotypes have been flown in space including Col-0, Ler, Ws and Cvi ( Paul et al., 2017 ; Choi et al., 2019 ). Interestingly, the Col-0 ecotype was found to be more responsive to the spaceflight environment compared to both Ws and Ler with more DEGs detected overall. A direct comparison of our results (on light grown Col-0 shoots) with the previous studies is hampered by the fact that they utilized either root tips or etiolated whole seedlings. Nevertheless, when we compare our findings with other spaceflight experiments, we find that two common features stand out; many experiments have reported altered expression of genes involved in cell wall modification and photosynthesis/plastid related genes. Two unexpected findings of our experiments are the potential regulation by the transcription factor Elongated Hypocotyl 5(HY5) and the altered expression of a few gravitropism related genes. 4.1.1 Cell wall related genes Genes involved in remodeling of plant cell walls have been reported to be differentially expressed in previous spaceflight experiments ( Paul et al., 2013 ; Kwon et al., 2015 ; Johnson et al., 2017 ; Choi et al., 2019 ; Nakashima et al., 2023 ). Glycomic analysis of spaceflight plant samples have shown changes in cell wall glycans, consistent with spaceflight related modification of cell walls ( Johnson et al., 2017 ; Nakashima et al., 2023 ). Similar to these previous reports, we also observed that genes involved in cell wall modification are overrepresented in our datasets; particularly we found approximately 100 genes associated with cell wall organization and modification downregulated in µ g . These included genes encoding for several members of the xyloglucan endotransglucosylase (XTH) family, expansins, peroxidases, pectin esterases and polygalacturonases. These cell wall proteins are involved in cell wall polymer rearrangement which occurs during cell elongation ( Irshad et al., 2008 ). The individual genes in these enzyme categories however, were not conserved between our dataset and the previous reports; probably due to differences in tissue type, age and growth conditions. We also found cellulose synthase-like genes and 6 genes encoding for dirigent proteins which are involved in lignin biosynthesis to be downregulated in µ g . 4.1.2 Chloroplast and photosynthesis related genes The mis-regulation or altered regulation of photosynthesis related genes has been reported for many spaceflight experiments including those that focused on seedlings grown in the dark ( Kwon et al., 2015 ; Kruse et al., 2020 ). The investigators who conducted the EMCS experiments SG2 and SG3, (Vandenbrink et al., Herranz et al., and Villacampa et al.) reported that genes involved in photosynthesis were enriched in both µ g upregulated and µ g downregulated datasets. We did not detect photosynthesis related genes upregulated in µ g in either PS or PRR, perhaps due to the differences in the lighting regime compared with the SG series of experiments. However, we do see enrichment for genes involved in photosynthesis and plastid function downregulated in µ g . Plastid localization was an enriched GO term for cellular localization accounting for approximately 300 genes in the µ g downregulated category of our dataset. Genes encoding for subunits of the NADPH complex, LHCA and photosystem I and II core were downregulated in µ g in both PS and PRR. We also found that several of the µ g downregulated miRNA targets were associated with plastids. Since many of these spaceflight studies have focused on young Arabidopsis seedlings, it is not clear if the altered regulation of genes associated with photosynthesis and chloroplast function would persist in fully grown plants. Whether such adjustments continue to maturity and how they may impact the photosynthetic capacity of plants will need to be evaluated in future spaceflight experiments. 4.1.3 HY5 target genes Genes differentially expressed in µ g in both PS and PRR were significantly enriched for HY5 target genes. HY5 is a central regulator of photomorphogenesis and may directly or indirectly affect the expression of approximately one third of the Arabidopsis genome ( Lee et al., 2007 ; Gangappa and Botto, 2016 ). HY5 is involved in integrating light and hormonal signals to regulate developmental processes in plants. In addition to a major role in light mediated signaling, HY5 is implicated in nutrient uptake and utilization, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and response to fluctuations in temperature ( Xiao et al., 2021 ). HY5 targets were significantly enriched in the genes upregulated in µ g (hypergeometric test, p =2.45e-11). The µ g upregulated HY5 targets were associated with organ development, light responses and auxin transport. We also found a significant enrichment of HY5 targets in the genes downregulated in µ g (hypergeometric test, p =1.698e-120). Many of the downregulated HY5 targets were involved in abiotic and biotic stress responses. 4.1.4 Gravitropism related genes Curiously, we found some gravitropism related genes to be upregulated in µ g . Among these, the TF Shoot Gravitropism 5 ( SGR5 ) was upregulated in µ g at both Day 4 and Day 6. SGR5 was first described as being important for the gravitropic response of Arabidopsis inflorescence stems ( Yamauchi et al., 1997 ). Further studies showed that SGR5 is localized in the shoot endodermis and that amyloplast sedimentation in the shoot endodermis is slower in the sgr5 mutant ( Morita et al., 2006 ; Tanimoto et al., 2008 ). SGR5 is also known as Indeterminate Domain 15 (IDD15). The IDD TFs IDD14, IDD15 and IDD16 have been shown to work cooperatively to regulate auxin transport in the shoot and play a role in aerial tissue development and gravitropic responses ( Cui et al., 2013 ). We found IDD14 to be upregulated in µ g , as well as another gene involved in regulating gravitropic response – LAZY1 . LAZY1 is expressed primarily in shoots of young seedlings and the early stages of the hypocotyl gravitropism were affected in a lazy1 mutant ( Yoshihara and Spalding, 2017 ). The LAZY proteins are thought to act early in the gravity signaling cascade by transmitting positional information on amyloplast sedimentation upstream of auxin redistribution ( Nishimura et al., 2023 ). The upregulation of these genes under µ g maybe related to their roles in regulating auxin flow; a closer look at their localization and dynamics under microgravity would be informative. 4.2 The Influence of developmental stage on observed transcriptional responses The differences in gene expression between µ g and 1 g at Day 4 and Day 6 in PRR, revealed that many more genes were responsive to µ g at Day 6 than at Day 4. Since the Day 4 and Day 6 samples for each condition were obtained from the same rotor and collected at the same time, these differences suggest that the developmental stage of the seedlings can have a profound effect on observed transcriptional responses. The variation between Day 4 and Day 6 samples grown in 1 g and µ g , was also evident in the PCA plot where principal component 1, (which captured 53% of the variation between samples), clearly separated the Day 4 and Day 6 samples at 1 g ; however, this separation was not observed in samples grown under the µ g condition. This indicates that differences in gene expression between the Day 4 and Day 6 samples in 1 g are either masked or not present in µ g . A possible explanation for this observation is that there are differences between 1 g and µ g grown seedlings in their developmental progression. To determine if there were delays in germination between 1 g and µ g that could result in altered development we examined germination time by interrogating the sequential series of images obtained throughout the PRR experiment. We found no difference in the timing of the first occurrence of radicle emergence between µ g and 1 g seedlings. We conclude that there was no delay in germination under µ g ; additionally, growth at Day 6 ( Figure 3 ) was similar between µ g and 1 g conditions. Although we did not see gross differences in growth, given the short timeframe of this experiment, we cannot rule out that there may be subtle changes which could become more pronounced as the plants mature. Longer duration experiments with a finer resolution of time points would be required to fully characterize and understand the regulatory underpinnings for these differences. 4.3 Lessons learned for future spaceflight experiments 4.3.1 Long term plant experiments The PS and PRR experiments were focused on a narrow window of the Arabidopsis life cycle; the TROPI seed cassettes and EC arrangement only supported short duration experiments. Therefore we cannot extrapolate or assume that the transcriptional response to microgravity seen in these experiments would be universally applicable to long duration plant experiments on the ISS. Furthermore the seed cassettes provide a controlled optimal environment for seedling growth with sufficient lighting, moisture and humidity without inherent spaceflight associated limitations of water delivery that are manifest in larger plant growth habitats. Long term experiments where plants are grown from seed to maturity are needed to characterize critical stages in plant development. This approach will lead to a better understanding of the physiology of plant adaptations to the space environment. 4.3.2 Multiple bioreplicates Both PS and PRR included two experimental runs or bioreplicates. Although the replicates for each spaceflight were carried out back to back in the same hardware, and from the same flight builds, we detected run to run variation in responses. Run to run variation may be caused by other spaceflight related conditions that could differ on a day to day basis on the ISS. While this disparity did not overshadow the major transcriptional changes that were conserved between the PS and PRR experiments, it could be misleading if results from only a single experiment are considered. This underscores the importance of being able to conduct replicate spaceflight experiments. 4.3.3 Combined OMIC approaches We acknowledge that single-time-point studies are snapshots of “steady-state” transcriptional profiles which, on their own, are not sufficient to capture the full range and continuum of regulation. However, single-time-point transcriptional studies are valuable in that they can help identify key transcriptional regulators and they offer the first signs of pathways which may be altered. The inclusion of sRNA profiling in combination with RNA-Seq can provide clues on an additional layer of post transcriptional regulation and upcoming spaceflight experiments are likely to incorporate both these forms of analyses. While the proteome may be a more direct readout of response, spaceflight experiments frequently have insufficient amounts of tissue for large scale proteomic studies; additional hurdles include the cost and the paucity of well annotated reference protein databases. Only a few flight experiments to date, have taken a proteomic approach ( Ferl et al., 2014 ; Mazars et al., 2014 ; Zhang et al., 2015 ; Kruse et al., 2020 ), and fewer still have been able to include both proteomic and transcriptomic analyses ( Kruse et al., 2020 ). Moving forward it will be important to employ multiple OMICs approaches to study a spaceflight experiment. The larger plant habitats on the ISS such as Veggie and the Advanced Plant Habitat (APH) can better support these endeavors. Ultimately, the biochemical and metabolic status of the plants will be indicative of their adaptations to their new environment.","Data availability statement The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.

Changes due to preservation method eclipsed those between flight and ground samples, making it difficult to identify spaceflight-specific changes. Follow-on experiments to interrogate the roles of euthanasia methods, tissue and carcass preservation protocols, and library preparation methods suggested that differences due to preservation protocols are exacerbated when coupled with polyA selection.

This system has clear similarities to its vertebrate counterparts: a weight-lending mass, an epithelial layer containing small supporting cells and the large sensory hair cells, and an output eliciting compensatory body reflexes to perturbations. Methodology/Principal Findings In terrestrial gastropod snail we studied the impact of 16- (Foton M-2) and 12-day (Foton M-3) exposure to microgravity in unmanned orbital missions on: (i) the whole animal behavior ( Helix lucorum L.), (ii) the statoreceptor responses to tilt in an isolated neural preparation ( Helix lucorum L.), and (iii) the differential expression of the Helix pedal peptide (HPep) and the tetrapeptide FMRFamide genes in neural structures ( Helix aspersa L.). Experiments were performed 13–42 hours after return to Earth. Latency of body re-orientation to sudden 90° head-down pitch was significantly reduced in postflight snails indicating an enhanced negative gravitaxis response. Statoreceptor responses to tilt in postflight snails were independent of motion direction, in contrast to a directional preference observed in control animals. Positive relation between tilt velocity and firing rate was observed in both control and postflight snails, but the response magnitude was significantly larger in postflight snails indicating an enhanced sensitivity to acceleration. A significant increase in mRNA expression of the gene encoding HPep, a peptide linked to ciliary beating, in statoreceptors was observed in postflight snails; no differential expression of the gene encoding FMRFamide, a possible neurotransmission modulator, was observed. Conclusions/Significance Upregulation of statocyst function in snails following microgravity exposure parallels that observed in vertebrates suggesting fundamental principles underlie gravi-sensing and the organism's ability to adapt to gravity changes. This simple animal model offers the possibility to describe general subcellular mechanisms of nervous system's response to conditions on Earth and in space.",Introduction,Materials and Methods,Results,Discussion,"Discussion Space flight offers unique opportunities to study how gravity shapes life on Earth. It also offers novel challenges to the organism. Upon entry into microgravity (µG) the astronaut typically experiences a Space Adaptation Syndrome consisting of a varying degree of disorientation similar in many ways to terrestrial motion sickness. Within days symptoms mostly weaken and dissipate over the course of the mission. After space flight as brief as 1–2 weeks the astronaut undergoes a new adaptation phase or a re-adaptation to Earth's 1 G [12] . Vestibular studies conducted in space clearly show that the near elimination of the linear acceleration of gravity directly impacts the function of the human otolith organs [12] , [13] . Studies in lower vertebrates, such as fish [7] , [14] , [15] and amphibians [16] – [19] , have revealed remarkably similar results that reflect direct changes in gravireception of the otolith organs. The vertebrate otolith organs and the invertebrate statolith organs show a strong structural correspondence, likely due to their ancestral involvement in balance and equilibrium [20] – [22] . There is also developing evidence of molecular homology of the snail statoreceptors with the vertebrate hair cells [23] . Thus, it is possible that the snail might serve as a model organism in space neurobiology studies. In addition to Foton M-2 and M-3 (present study), snails have flown on the Shuttle, Russian space station MIR, and International Space Station missions in the past [24] – [27] , and will be discussed in greater detail below. In this study we investigated the structure and function of the gravi-sensing statocyst receptor as rapidly as possible following exposure to spaceflight in two separate missions. We assume that the observed changes were primarily the result of µG exposure. In-flight monitoring of statocyst function was not technically feasible in these missions. We observed a change, an upregulation, in the expression of a peptide associated with the statocyst. Pedal peptide was first identified by Lloyd in sea slug Aplysia californica [28] . The precise role of this peptide in the nervous system is still unknown. However, it has been shown that pedal peptide modulated the ciliary beat frequency of epithelial cells in Tritonia [29] . In 1997 the gene encoding pedal peptide was identified in terrestrial snail Helix lucorum [11] . Based on in situ hybridization data this gene is widely expressed in the nervous system of Helix and in some statoreceptors as well. Taking into account the known effect of pedal peptide on cilia beating and muscle contraction [30] , we can assume that it might play an important role in the regulation of mechanical transduction processes of the hair bundles of statoreceptors, such as regulation of actin-myosin complex within the cilia [31] – [33] , and the observed change in expression of gene encoding pedal peptide ( Table 2 ) suggests existence of lasting influence of the flight. Despite the small number of receptor cells in each statocyst, they were uniformly labelled for this pedal neuropeptide. A feasible interpretation of these HPep data is the existence of a mosaic expression of different peptides in the receptors [8] . This mosaic pattern is believed to encode varying information on the position and relative movement of the snail. In this case the degree of HPep expression from an almost negligible level to a significant level may indicate a change in signal transmitted to the nervous system from the gravi-sensing organ. It is tempting to speculate that the HPep expression patterns observed in postflight snails directly reflect, at least in part, the recorded behavioral and physiological changes, but this remains to be proven. In the M-3 mission we also investigated the expression pattern of the FMRFamide gene in postflight and control snails using mRNA expression techniques. Although FMRFamide is not normally expressed in statocyst receptor cells [34] , this neuropeptide can act to reduce calcium influx via regulation of the cell's secretory machinery [35] , thereby modulating synaptic transmission, and perhaps playing a role in synaptic plasticity [36] . More recent evidence suggests that the expression and regulation of an FMRFamide-related neuropeptide gene family are possibly linked to the state of the organism [37] . No differential expression of the preproFMRFa gene was observed in the statocysts of control or postflight M-3 snails. Thus, our data suggest that FMRFamide is an unlikely candidate involved in the statocyst response to the novel space environment. We measured the whole statocyst nerve activity in one recording session in control and postflight snails, and observed a significant increase in the total number of spikes in the postflight snails. This technique minimized any potential trauma to the statocyst organ itself and was considered the optimal method given the time-sensitive nature of the data. However, it does leave open the question as to the source of the overall level of excitation. The postflight increase in the total spike number could be the result of amplifying the normal discharges of responding cells or recruiting otherwise non-responding cells or both. To adequately answer this question we must wait until preflight and postflight recordings are made in each animal under identical recording conditions. The physiological results reported here in the isolated statocyst in snails are in line with the vertebrate data [7] , [12] , [13] , and conform to the proposition that µG exposure leads to changes in gravireceptor function. At the same time this similarity in neural response to µG exposure between the vertebrates and invertebrates is intriguing: the increased neural sensitivity in the vertebrate was detected in the otolith nerve afferents [7] , one synapse away from the hair cell, whereas the increased neural sensitivity reported here in the snail was detected directly at the receptor level. Both the vertebrate otolith and invertebrate statolith structures are physically arranged for an optimal response to 1 G perceived during their development, and any departure from this arrangement in either direction will induce a perturbation of the detection mechanisms. However, the common neural response might be driven by shared or completely independent mechanism(s) with reference to adaptation to altered gravity. Different speculative hypotheses have been proposed [7] . In light of the current results in snails we need to re-open this debate. Possible mechanisms underlying the adaptive changes in statocyst function following µG exposure might involve a structural reformation, a change in neural signaling, or even a mixture of both. Structural Changes A widely considered mechanism is a change in the weight-lending statoconia (or otoconia). Structurally, these are minute calcareous particles surmounting the neural epithelium. In µG, it is argued, the organism counters the loss of the gravity vector by increasing calcium carbonate production and depositing more mass on the statoconia. The total weight of the statoconia mass remains negligible while in µG, and thus changes are seen upon return to normal 1 G. A number of studies support this argument. The test mass (utricular or saccular otolith or statolith) of the fresh-water pond snail, Biomphalaria glabrata [25] , marine mollusk, Aplysia californica [24] , Xenopus [38] , [39] , newt [24] , and swordtail fish [25] reared in space increased relative to ground-reared controls. In the opposite sense the test mass in Aplysia californica [24] and cichlid fish [25] born in hypergravity was reduced [24] . Exposure to µG has been linked to an increased growth of the statoconia in Helix [26] , similar to the reported results in other species. However, the predominant evidence in other species studied during developmental or adult stages is either no effect on test mass or ambiguous results [40] – [47] . In the fish the neural response to µG exposure was manifested in hypersensitivity without a distortion of its directional selectivity, and readaptation, defined as the process of adaptation to normal gravity, occurred relatively quickly [7] . In the present results the snail's neural response to µG exposure was manifested also in hypersensitivity, but with a loss of its directional selectivity. Although this finding does not confirm a structural change has occurred in the snail, it cannot be ruled out. It may also be hypothesized that the unweighting of the statoconia mass in µG induces a change in the mechanical linkage between the statoconia and hair cell stereocilia, but a morphological analysis is required to test this possibility. The prevailing evidence in the vertebrate pointed towards an increase in synaptic strength originating in the hair cell and conveyed to the afferent contacts. The experimental findings in rat [48] , [49] provided direct evidence that reformation of the hair cell synaptic machinery can be caused by µG. An increase in the number of synaptic ribbons in rat utricular hair cells as a result of µG exposure is in line with the increased sensitivity found in fish utricular afferents [7] . In the snail (present results) the increased sensitivity was found directly in the hair cell itself, thus excluding a mechanism utilizing plasticity of the hair cell-afferent synaptic complex. It should be noted that no direct membrane measurements have been taken from vertebrate hair cells following µG exposure, thereby leaving open the possibility that the increased sensitivity observed in the nerve afferents simply reflected an increased sensitivity of the receptor potential in the hair cell itself. In other words, a common mechanism in regulation of the hair cell sensitivity between invertebrate and vertebrates cannot be excluded. Changes in Cellular Signaling A direct action on intracellular signaling might occur in the gravi-receptor itself. Without empirical evidence acquired in flight we can only speculate on the possibility of modifiable elements, such as changes in myosin motors or ionic channels, within the cell. Sensory receptors in invertebrates can generate action potentials and these potentials are modifiable by changes in environmental conditions, for example during learning. The primary sensory neuron is the first site at which cellular plasticity occurs during classical conditioning [50] . In the conditioned Hermissenda an enhanced excitability in type B photoreceptors involves a reduction in the peak amplitude of voltage-dependent (I A , I Ca ) and Ca 2+ -dependent (I K,Ca ) currents, an increase in the input resistance, and an increase of firing rate elicited by the conditioned stimulus (CS) or extrinsic current [51] – [53] . In type A photoreceptors an enhanced excitability to extrinsic current, increases in CS-elicited firing rate, and decreases in the magnitude of two K+ currents are seen [54] – [58] . In Lymnaea classical conditioning can be directly mediated by the statocyst hair cells and sensory information for associative learning converges onto the cell [59] . At least 3 distinct K+ currents are expressed in the soma of hair cells [60] and modification of these channels would likely influence its excitability. Mature vertebrate hair cells develop generator or receptor potentials, but their plasticity to environmental variations is largely unknown. Delayed expressions of voltage-gated sodium current [61] and potassium currents [62] have been reported in neonatal utricular hair cells of rats raised in hypergravity, suggesting a direct influence of altered gravity on sensory cell sensitivity. Prolonged deviation of the sensory hair bundle can lead to adaptation of otolith hair cell receptor potentials [63] , [64] . In the opposite sense prolonged unweighting of the otolith mass and thus tonic unloading of the otolith stereocilia could conceivably lead to adaptation of receptor potentials. A manifestation of this adaptation can be seen in the responses of some otolith afferents to prolonged steps of linear acceleration [65] , [66] . Microgravity might be thought of as a step of motion of the hair bundle in the “off” direction for the hair cell, and adaptation in the transducer mechanism might negate any aberrant afferent response in µG. The onset and time course of adaptation response of the transducer might be both rapid and long-lasting, but remains conjectural. One last mechanism needs to be considered. In addition to the feed-forward flow of signals from the hair cells to the more central cell areas that process the information to provide orientation, balance, and muscle tonus, a centrifugal pathway exists from the more central areas back to the sensory organs themselves. This efferent pathway is known for the gastropod statocyst [67] and cephalopod [68] , [69] , and in vertebrates for all hair cell structures [70] – [73] . In Hermissenda hair cells are capable of inhibiting neighboring hair cells and those on the opposite side via chemical and electrical synapses [74] , [75] . In the toadfish efferent vestibular neurons directly inhibit the hair cell by shunting its membrane potential and at the same time increase the afferent firing rate [76] , thereby effectively enhancing signal processing, for example, during large and rapid escape or feeding behaviors. In series of experiments on a Foton satellite and aboard the Mir space station this feedback mechanism was studied in the snail [27] . Eliminating the feedback to the statoreceptors by severing its nerve between 31–36 h after landing did not alter the firing rate in proximal portion of the nerve in postflight snails, but it did so in control snails, leading these investigators to conclude that µG exposure might inactivate the efferent innervation of the statoreceptors. Although it is likely that hair cells are under a continuous efferent adjustment based on prevailing behavioral requirements, it is not yet known whether the efferent innervation of the hair cell organs in any species is capable of a long-term calibrating influence based on the existing gravity level.",Conclusions/Significance,Functional changes in the snail statocyst system elicited by microgravity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3066201/,

An all-solid-state ion-selective-electrode (ASSISE) is especially attractive for the aforementioned applications. The electrode should have the following favorable characteristics: easy construction, low maintenance, and (potential for) miniaturization, allowing for batch processing. A microfabricated ASSISE intended for quantifying H + , Ca 2+ , and CO 3 2- ions was constructed. It consists of a noble-metal electrode layer ( i.e. Pt), a transduction layer, and an ion-selective membrane (ISM) layer. The transduction layer functions to transduce the concentration-dependent chemical potential of the ion-selective membrane into a measurable electrical signal. The lifetime of an ASSISE is found to depend on maintaining the potential at the conductive layer/membrane interface 5-7 . To extend the ASSISE working lifetime and thereby maintain stable potentials at the interfacial layers, we utilized the conductive polymer (CP) poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) 7-9 in place of silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) as the transducer layer. We constructed the ASSISE in a lab-on-a-chip format, which we called the multi-analyte biochip (MAB) ( Figure 1 ). Calibrations in test solutions demonstrated that the MAB can monitor pH (operational range pH 4-9), CO 3 2- (measured range 0.01 mM - 1 mM), and Ca 2+ (log-linear range 0.01 mM to 1 mM). The MAB for pH provides a near-Nernstian slope response after almost one month storage in algal medium. The carbonate biochips show a potentiometric profile similar to that of a conventional ion-selective electrode. Physiological measurements were employed to monitor biological activity of the model system, the microalga Chlorella vulgaris . The MAB conveys an advantage in size, versatility, and multiplexed analyte sensing capability, making it applicable to many confined monitoring situations, on Earth or in space. Biochip Design and Experimental Methods The biochip is 10 x 11 mm in dimension and has 9 ASSISEs designated as working electrodes (WEs) and 5 Ag/AgCl reference electrodes (REs). Each working electrode (WE) is 240 μm in diameter and is equally spaced at 1.4 mm from the REs, which are 480 μm in diameter. These electrodes are connected to electrical contact pads with a dimension of 0.5 mm x 0.5 mm. The schematic is shown in Figure 2 . Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic deposition methods are used to electropolymerize the PEDOT films using a Bioanalytical Systems Inc. (BASI) C3 cell stand ( Figure 3 ). The counter-ion for the PEDOT film is tailored to suit the analyte ion of interest. A PEDOT with poly(styrenesulfonate) counter ion (PEDOT/PSS) is utilized for H + and CO 3 2- , while one with sulphate (added to the solution as CaSO 4 ) is utilized for Ca 2+ . The electrochemical properties of the PEDOT-coated WE is analyzed using CVs in redox-active solution ( i.e. 2 mM potassium ferricyanide (K 3 Fe(CN) 6 )). Based on the CV profile, Randles-Sevcik analysis was used to determine the effective surface area 10 . Spin-coating at 1,500 rpm is used to cast ~2 μm thick ion-selective membranes (ISMs) on the MAB working electrodes (WEs). The MAB is contained in a microfluidic flow-cell chamber filled with a 150 μl volume of algal medium; the contact pads are electrically connected to the BASI system ( Figure 4 ).

Although it is known that the unique geometry of venous valves alters the blood flow patterns and cell distribution in venous valve sinuses, the interactions between fluid flow and RBCs have not been elucidated. Here, using a dilute cell suspension in an in vitro microfluidic model of a venous valve, we quantified the spatial distribution of RBCs by microscopy and image analysis, and using micro-particle image velocimetry and 3D computational fluid dynamics simulations, we analyzed the complex flow patterns. The results show that the local hematocrit in the valve pockets is spatially heterogeneous and is significantly different from the feed hematocrit. Above a threshold shear rate, the inertial separation of streamlines and lift forces contribute to an uneven distribution of RBCs in the vortices, the entrapment of RBCs in the vortices, and non-monotonic wall shear stresses in the valve pockets. Our experimental and computational characterization provides insights into the complex interactions between fluid flow, RBC distribution, and wall shear rates in venous valve mimics, which is of relevance to understanding the pathophysiology of thrombosis and improving cell separation efficiency.",,,,,,,The interaction of vortical flows with red cells in venous valve mimics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8896891/,

Spaceflight experiments remain resource intensive and rare. One outstanding issue is how to maximize scientific output from a limited number of omics datasets from traditional animal models including nematodes, fruitfly, and rodents. The utility of omics data from invertebrate models in anticipating mammalian responses to spaceflight has not been fully explored. Hence, we performed comparative analyses of transcriptomes of soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) in mice that underwent 37 days of spaceflight. Results indicate shared stress responses and altered circadian rhythm. EDL showed more robust growth signals and Pde2a downregulation, possibly underlying its resistance to atrophy versus soleus. Spaceflight and hindlimb unloading mice shared differential regulation of proliferation, circadian, and neuronal signaling. Shared gene regulation in muscles of humans on bedrest and space flown rodents suggest targets for mitigating muscle atrophy in space and on Earth. Spaceflight responses of C. elegans were more similar to EDL. Discrete life stages of D. melanogaster have distinct utility in anticipating EDL and soleus responses.

In this study, high aspect ratio vessel S. mutans simulated microgravity and normal gravity cultures were assessed for changes in metabolite and transcriptome profiles, H 2 O 2 resistance, and competence in sucrose-containing biofilm media. Stationary phase S. mutans simulated microgravity cultures displayed increased killing by H 2 O 2 compared to normal gravity control cultures, but competence was not affected. RNA-seq analysis revealed that expression of 153 genes was up-regulated ≥2-fold and 94 genes down-regulated ≥2-fold during simulated microgravity high aspect ratio vessel growth. These included a number of genes located on extrachromosomal elements, as well as genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, translation, and stress responses.

The agr operon gene transcripts were also highly upregulated during spaceflight, followed by genes encoding phenol-soluble modulins and secreted proteases, which are positively regulated by Agr. Upregulated spaceflight genes/proteins also had functions related to urease activity, type VII-like Ess secretion, and copper transport. We also performed secretome analysis of BRIC-23 culture supernatants, which revealed that spaceflight samples had increased abundance of secreted virulence factors, including Agr-regulated proteases (SspA, SspB), staphylococcal nuclease (Nuc), and EsxA (secreted by the Ess system).

Exposure to 2-g hypergravity (HG) during pregnancy and lactation decreased rate of mammary metabolic activity and increased pup mortality. We hypothesize HG disrupted maternal homeorhetic responses to pregnancy and lactation are due to changes in maternal metabolism, hormone concentrations, and maternal behavior related to gravity induced alterations in circadian clocks. Effect of HG exposure on mammary, liver and adipose tissue metabolism, plasma hormones and maternal behavior were analyzed in rat dams from mid-pregnancy (Gestational day [G]11) through early lactation (Postnatal day [P]3); comparisons were made across five time-points: G20, G21, P0 (labor and delivery), P1 and P3. Blood, mammary, liver, and adipose tissue were collected for analyzing plasma hormones, glucose oxidation to CO 2 and incorporation into lipids, or gene expression. Maternal behavioral phenotyping was conducted using time-lapse videographic analyses. Dam and fetal-pup body mass were significantly reduced in HG in all age groups. HG did not affect labor and delivery; however, HG pups experienced a greater rate of mortality. PRL, corticosterone, and insulin levels and receptor genes were altered by HG. Mammary, liver and adipose tissue metabolism and expression of genes that regulate lipid metabolism were altered by HG exposure. Exposure to HG significantly changed expression of core clock genes in mammary and liver and circadian rhythms of maternal behavior. Gravity load alterations in dam's circadian system may have impacted homeorhetic adaptations needed for a successful lactation.",Introduction,Materials and Methods,Results,Discussion,"Materials and Methods Animals and treatment conditions All animal procedures were approved by the NASA Ames Research Center IACUC. Sixty-four time-bred female Sprague-Dawley rats ( Rattus norvegicus ; Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY, USA), weighing between 190–280g, were used. Animals were assigned to one of five stages (n = 16 per group) corresponding to different time-points across the periparturient period. These were: G20, G21, P0 (birth), P1 (onset of lactation) and P3 (lactation day 3). During the period G2–G6, the dams were individually housed in maternity cages (47cm ×26cm ×21cm) lined with corncob bedding and maintained under standard colony conditions (12∶12 light/dark cycle [0600∶1800]; 21±1°C at 30–50% humidity). On G7, the dams were housed in custom designed metabolic cages allowing for the clean separation of urine and feces for collection and analysis. Standard rat chow (Purina #5012, pellets in maternity cages and powdered in metabolic cages) and water were available ad libitum. On G9, dams were assigned to the either hypergravity (HG) (n = 8) or control (n = 8) conditions with body weights matched across groups. Hypergravity (HG) dams were placed on the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) 24 ft centrifuge and exposed to continuous 2-g (20.1 rpm). The centrifuge was stopped daily (approximately 1h duration) for animal maintenance, veterinary inspection and data collection. Control dams were housed in the metabolic cages in the same room as the experimental dams. Both groups were therefore exposed to identical environmental conditions (light, sound, temperature, and humidity). On G21, the day prior to birth, dams were transferred from metabolic cages to standard maternity cages. Real time videography onboard the rotating centrifuge was used to identify the precise time of birth for each dam. For the P0 group, the centrifuge was briefly (<15 min) stopped three times per day at eight hr intervals to retrieve dams that were undergoing labor contractions or birth. For the P1 group, animals were retrieved within 18 to 36 h following birth. In polytocous species, milk yield and body weight gain per pup are inversely related to litter size ( Kumaresan et al., 1967 ). Therefore, on P1, HG and control litters were yoked and their sizes adjusted so that numbers and genders of pups comprising each litter were matched across conditions. Litter size was further adjusted daily by noting the numbers of dead or missing neonates in HG litters, and then removing the equivalent number of offspring from the corresponding control litter. Gender composition of the matched HG litter was preserved in litter adjustments. Animals were euthanized at the same time of day in both groups to account for circadian variations. Dam body mass, organ mass and body composition Dams in each condition were weighed daily throughout the study. Dam body composition was analyzed using TOBEC® (Total Body Electrical Conductivity) instrumentation (EM-SCAN Inc., Springfield, IL, USA) just prior to euthanasia. Briefly, the TOBEC® instrument measures energy absorption in the presence of a radio-frequency electromagnetic field, calibrated to match the response of a conductivity sensing element. Energy absorption is increased in conductive materials (i.e., hydrated, lean tissue) as compared to highly resistive materials (i.e., fur, body fat) ( Harrison and Van Itallie, 1982 ; Bracco et al., 1983 ; Presta et al., 1983 ). Following euthanasia of the dams, selected organ weights were measured. Offspring body mass, crown-rump length (CRL) and placental mass Fetuses in the G20 and G21 age groups were surgically delivered from anesthetized dams. Neonatal rats in the P0, P1 and P3 conditions underwent vaginal delivery on G22 or 23. Pup survival was determined by counting the total number of pups at the time of birth and again during subsequent centrifuge stops. Body mass and crown-rump length (CRL) were measured at each perinatal age. Placental mass was measured on G20 and G21. Maternal behavior analysis Housing enclosures were configured for high-resolution video recording, including red illumination to permit recording during the dark phase of the circadian cycle. Beginning on G22, HG-exposed and control dams were continuously videotaped using a 24h timelapse (12∶1 record:playback ratio) system. During playback of the videotapes, detailed analyses of overall activity, self-grooming, eating and drinking, tail chasing, digging and nest building, licking pups, retrieving pups and ingesting carcasses of moribund and/or dead pups using a time locked computer analysis system according to Ronca et al. ( Ronca et al., 2001 ). Blood collection and analysis Blood samples were obtained by cardiac puncture from the anesthetized dams, and plasma was prepared and immediately frozen for later analysis. In order to establish basal hormonal levels, dams were removed from their pups 2h prior to anesthesia. Commercially available radioimmunoassay and ELISA kits were used for measurement of plasma concentrations of PRL, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH; both from Amersham, Piscataway, NJ, USA), triiodothryronine (T3), thyroxine (T4) (Diagnostic Products, Los Angeles, CA, USA), and corticosterone (Cort, Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Webster, TX, USA). INS and leptin (LEP) levels were determined using kits from Linco Research (Irvine, CA, USA). Blood glucose, cholesterol, total protein and triglyceride levels were measured using the Dade Behring Dimension® XpandT Clinical Chemistry System (Dade Behring, Newark DE, USA). Dam tissue collection and metabolic assays At each experimental time-point, mammary gland #4, liver and abdominal adipose tissues were collected from anesthetized dams. Mammary and liver tissues were kept on ice in tris sucrose and adipose tissue was kept at 37°C in a saline solution until processing. Tissues were sliced into 0.5 mm sections with a hand-held Stadie Riggs microtome. Sliced sections weighing 100–180 mg were used immediately to measure glucose metabolism in vitro . Remaining tissue was immersed in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for later isolation of total RNA. To determine metabolic rate, tissues were placed in stoppered flasks containing Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer with 10mM glucose, 1μg/ml INS and 1μCi/flask of uniformly labeled [ 14 C]-glucose to measure the rate of glucose oxidation to CO 2 and incorporation into lipids ( Bauman et al., 1970 ; Plaut et al., 2003 ). Adipose, liver and mammary tissues were incubated for 2, 3, and 4 h, respectively. During lactation (P1 and P3), adipose tissue lipolysis was measured. Therefore, glycerol release, rather than glucose incorporation into lipids, was measured. Adipose slices were placed in Krebs-Ringer Buffer in the absence of INS and incubated for 2 h. Media and tissue were collected and frozen. Glycerol released into media was measured using an enzymatic assay (R-Biopharm, Inc., Cat. No.: E 0148 270) with modifications described by McNamara and Hillers ( McNamara and Hillers, 1986 ). The method used to measure metabolic rate has been previously described and validated to confirm that values represent actual mammary tissue metabolism ( Bauman et al., 1970 ; Bauman et al., 1973 ; Plaut et al., 1999b ; Plaut et al., 2003 ). Preliminary studies were also performed to validate metabolic rate measures in liver and adipose tissue. Optimal buffer choice, tris-sucrose or saline, and the temperature at which to hold the tissues (4°C, 37°C) prior to the assay were also determined. Optimal incubation time for these two tissues was determined by comparing metabolic rates following 1, 2, 3 or 4h of incubation. As shown by Etherton and Allen ( Etherton and Allen, 1980 ), it was necessary to keep adipose tissue warm (37°C) in a saline solution prior to assay to prevent tissue hardening and death. Adipose tissue metabolic activity increased linearly for 2h of incubation. Activity reached a plateau and then began to decline after 2–3h. Therefore, optimal measures of adipose tissue metabolism were obtained after 2 h of incubation. Optimal buffer and holding temperature for liver prior to assay were determined to be tris-sucrose buffer on ice. Liver tissue metabolic activity increased linearly for 4–5h of incubation, thus liver tissue was incubated for 4h to measure metabolism. In addition, numerous studies utilizing metabolic assays to study toxicology and drug metabolism have determined that liver slices incubated for at least 4h and up to 20h remain viable during this time ( Smith et al., 1985 ; Dogterom, 1993 ; Ekins, 1996 ; de Graaf et al., 2000 ; Maas et al., 2000 ; de Graaf et al., 2002 ). Isolation of total RNA and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTq-PCR) Total RNA was isolated from mammary, liver and adipose tissue collected from G20 and P1 HG-treated and control dams and used to analyze gene expression of lipid metabolic enzymes and hormone receptors using RTq-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from frozen mammary, liver and adipose tissue using Trizol® Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Samples were DNase treated using the DNA- free TM kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). Total RNA was extracted from frozen visceral adipose tissue and DNase treated using RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) following manufacturer's suggested protocol. Quantity and quality of the RNA was assessed with the Nanodrop® ND-1000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA) and on the Nanochip using the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA), respectively. RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the GeneAmp® kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).

In this study, we found that the addition of the same or related apyrase inhibitors could potentiate the ability of different fungicides to inhibit the growth of five different pathogenic fungi in plate growth assays. The growth of all five fungi was partially inhibited by three commonly used fungicides: copper octanoate, myclobutanil and propiconazole. However, when these fungicides were individually tested in combination with any one of four different apyrase inhibitors (AI.1, AI.10, AI.13 or AI.15), their potency to inhibit the growth of five fungal pathogens was increased significantly relative to their application alone. The apyrase inhibitors were most effective in potentiating the ability of copper octanoate to inhibit fungal growth, and least effective in combination with propiconazole. Among the five pathogens assayed, that most sensitive to the fungicide‐potentiating effects of the inhibitors was Sclerotinia sclerotiorum . Overall, among the 60 treatment combinations tested (five pathogens, four apyrase inhibitors, three fungicides), the addition of apyrase inhibitors increased significantly the sensitivity of fungi to the fungicide treatments in 53 of the combinations. Consistent with their predicted mode of action, inhibitors AI.1, AI.10 and AI.13 each increased the level of propiconazole retained in one of the fungi, suggesting that they could partially block the ability of efflux transporters to remove propiconazole from these fungi.",,,,,,,Apyrase inhibitors enhance the ability of diverse fungicides to inhibit the growth of different plant-pathogenic fungi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6638264/,

In our previous study, we saw that head-tilt bedrest together with social isolation upregulated the milieu of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus and plasma. These changes were mitigated in a MCAT mouse model overexpressing human catalase in the mitochondria, pointing out the importance of ROS signaling in this stress response. Here, we used a head-tilt model in socially housed mice to tease out the effects of head-tilt bedrest without isolation. In order to find the underlying molecular mechanisms that provoked the cytokine response, we measured CD68, an indicator of microglial activation in the hippocampus, as well as changes in normal in-cage behavior. We hypothesized that hindlimb unloading (HU) will elicit microglial hippocampal activations, which will be mitigated in the MCAT ROS-quenching mice model. Indeed, we saw an elevation of the activated microglia CD68 marker following HU in the hippocampus, and this pathology was mitigated in MCAT mice. Additionally, we identified cytokines in the hippocampus, which had significant positive correlations with CD68 and negative correlations with exploratory behaviors, indicating a link between neuroinflammation and behavioral consequences.

The SOD1 G93A mouse model recapitulates many features of human ALS. These mice also exhibit decreased bone mass. However, the functional, or biomechanical, behavior of the skeleton in SOD1 G93A mice has not been investigated. To do so, we examined skeletal phenotypes in end-stage (16-week-old) SOD1 G93A female mice and healthy littermate female controls (N=9–10/group). Outcomes included trabecular and cortical bone microarchitecture by microcomputed tomography; stiffness and strength via three-point bending; resistance to crack growth by fracture toughness testing; and cortical bone matrix properties via cyclic reference point indentation. SOD1 G93A mice had similar bone size, but significantly lower trabecular bone mass (−54%), thinner trabeculae (−41%) and decreased cortical bone thickness (−17%) and cortical area (−18%) compared to control mice (all p<0.01). In line with these bone mass and microstructure deficits, SOD1 G93A mice had significantly lower femoral bending stiffness (−27%) and failure moment (−41%), along with decreased fracture toughness (−18%) (all p<0.001).

Ex vivo measurements of trabecular microarchitecture in the distal femur by microcomputed tomography revealed deficits in bone volume fraction, 2 and 4 weeks after unloading. Histologic analyses of trabecular bone in the distal femur revealed the decreased osteoblast number and mineralizing surface in unloaded rats. Three-point bending of the femoral diaphysis indicated modest or no reductions in femoral stiffness and estimated modulus due to PWB.

Among them, hindlimb suspension (HLS), developed in 1979 in rats, remains the gold‐standard and allows researchers to study the consequences of total unloading of the hind limbs while inducing a cephalic fluid shift. While this model has already brought valuable insights to space biology, few studies have directly compared functional decrements in the muscles of males and females during HLS. We exposed 28 adult Wistar rats (14 males and 14 females) to 14 days of HLS or normal loading (NL) to better assess how sex impacts disuse‐induced muscle deconditioning. Females better maintained muscle function during HLS than males, as shown by a more moderate reduction in grip strength at 7 days (males: −37.5 ± 3.1%, females: −22.4 ± 6.5%, compared to baseline), that remains stable during the second week of unloading (males: −53.3 ± 5.7%, females: −22.4 ± 5.5%, compared to day 0) while the males exhibit a steady decrease over time (effect of sex × loading p = 0.0002, effect of sex × time × loading p = 0.0099). This was further supported by analyzing the force production in response to a tetanic stimulus. Further functional analyses using force production were also shown to correspond to sex differences in relative loss of muscle mass and CSA. Moreover, our functional data were supported by histomorphometric analyzes, and we highlighted differences in relative muscle loss and CSA.

However, the knowledge about transcriptomic alterations caused by liquid cultivation remains limited. Moreover, the impact of different genotypes in rapid adaptive responses to environmental changes (e.g., liquid cultivation) is often overlooked. Here, we report the transcriptomic and phenotypic responses of laboratory N2 and the wild-isolate AB1 strains after culturing P 0 worms on agar plates, F 1 in liquid cultures, and F 2 back on agar plates. Results Significant variations were found in the gene expressions between the N2 and AB1 strains in response to liquid cultivation. The results demonstrated that 8–34% of the environmental change-induced transcriptional responses are transmitted to the subsequent generation. By categorizing the gene expressions for genotype, environment, and genotype-environment interactions, we identified that the genotype has a substantial impact on the adaptive responses. Functional analysis of the transcriptome showed correlation with phenotypical changes. For example, the N2 strain exhibited alterations in both phenotype and gene expressions for germline and cuticle in axenic liquid cultivation. We found transcript evidence to approximately 21% of the computationally predicted genes in C. elegans by exposing the worms to environmental changes. Conclusions The presented study reveals substantial differences between N2 and AB1 strains for transcriptomic and phenotypical responses to rapid environmental changes.

High-throughput technologies for screening natural and engineered cell populations can reveal cellular heterogeneity and identify high-performance cells. Here, we present a method to desiccate and preserve microbes in nanoliter-scale compartments, termed PicoShells, which are microparticles with a hollow inner cavity. In PicoShells, single cells are confined in an inner aqueous core by a porous hydrogel shell, allowing the diffusion of nutrients, wastes, and assay reagents for uninhibited cell growth and flexible assay protocols. Desiccated PicoShells offer analysis capabilities for single-cell derived colonies with a simple, low resource workflow, requiring only the addition of water to rehydrate hundreds of thousands of PicoShells and the single microbes encapsulated inside. Our desiccation method results in the recovery of desiccated microparticle morphology and porosity after a multi-week storage period and rehydration, with particle diameter and porosity metrics changing by less than 18% and 7%, respectively, compared to fresh microparticles. We also recorded the high viability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast desiccated and rehydrated inside PicoShells, with only a 14% decrease in viability compared to non-desiccated yeast over 8.5 weeks, although we observed an 85% decrease in initial growth potential over the same duration. We show a proof-of-concept for a growth rate-based analysis of single-cell derived colonies in rehydrated PicoShells, where we identified 11% of the population that grows at an accelerated rate.

These transcriptional features are reproducible and evident across many spaceflown species (e.g., mice and astronauts), supporting the use of C. elegans as a model organism to study spaceflight physiology with translational capital. Integrating tissue-specific, spatial, and multi-omics approaches, which quantitatively link molecular responses to phenotypic adaptations, will facilitate the identification of candidate regulatory molecules for therapeutic intervention and thus represents the next frontiers in C. elegans space omics research.",Introduction,,,,,Conclusion,Caenorhabditis elegans in microgravity: An omics perspective,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10344948/,

In animal studies, exposure to ionizing radiation increases oxidative damage in skeletal tissues, and results in an imbalance in bone remodeling initiated by increased bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Therefore, we evaluated various candidate interventions with antioxidant or anti-inflammatory activities (antioxidant cocktail, dihydrolipoic acid, ibuprofen, dried plum) both for their ability to blunt the expression of resorption-related genes in marrow cells after irradiation with either gamma rays (photons, 2 Gy) or simulated space radiation (protons and heavy ions, 1 Gy) and to prevent bone loss. Dried plum was most effective in reducing the expression of genes related to bone resorption ( Nfe2l2, Rankl, Mcp1, Opg, TNF-α ) and also preventing later cancellous bone decrements caused by irradiation with either photons or heavy ions. Thus, dietary supplementation with DP may prevent the skeletal effects of radiation exposures either in space or on Earth.",,Methods,Results,Discussion,,,Dried plum diet protects from bone loss caused by ionizing radiation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4750446/,

Future spaceflight missions will expose crew to extended periods of microgravity among other stressors, the effects of which on cardiovascular health are not fully known. In this study, we determined cardiac responses to extended microgravity exposure using the rat hindlimb unloading (HU) model. We hypothesized that exposure to prolonged simulated microgravity and subsequent recovery would lead to increased oxidative damage and altered expression of genes involved in the oxidative response. To test this hypothesis, we examined hearts of male (three and nine months of age) and female (3 months of age) Long–Evans rats that underwent HU for various durations up to 90 days and reambulated up to 90 days post-HU. Results indicate sex-dependent changes in oxidative damage marker 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and antioxidant gene expression in left ventricular tissue. Three-month-old females displayed elevated 8-OHdG levels after 14 days of HU while age-matched males did not. In nine-month-old males, there were no differences in 8-OHdG levels between HU and normally loaded control males at any of the timepoints tested following HU. RNAseq analysis of left ventricular tissue from nine-month-old males after 14 days of HU revealed upregulation of pathways involved in pro-inflammatory signaling, immune cell activation and differential expression of genes associated with cardiovascular disease progression. Taken together, these findings provide a rationale for targeting antioxidant and immune pathways and that sex differences should be taken into account in the development of countermeasures to maintain cardiovascular health in space.",1.

The current therapeutic options for CKD remain limited in efficacy. Consequently, the identification and exploration of novel drug targets for CKD are of paramount importance. We identified cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) with potential as drug targets from the eQTLGen Consortium database to serve as the exposure. For the outcome, we utilized a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of chronic kidney disease (CKD) from the FinnGen database, which comprised a case group of 11,265 individuals and a control group of 436,208 individuals. MR analysis was employed to investigate druggable genes closely associated with CKD. Subsequently, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were conducted to elucidate the functional roles of these significant genes. Finally, a colocalization analysis was conducted to determine the likelihood that a cis-eQTL for a druggable gene and CKD share a causal variant. The expression of 12 genes was found to be significantly associated with CKD risk, with a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.05. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses indicated that these genes are primarily involved in the regulation of MAP kinase activity, regulation of protein serine/threonine kinase activity, Gap junction, Platelet activation and Oxytocin signaling pathway. The colocalization analysis results suggested that CKD and the TUBB gene may share a causal variant, with a posterior probability (PP.H4) exceeding 80% (TUBB: 97.27%). Compelling statistical evidence indicates that TUBB represents the most promising pharmacological target for the treatment of CKD. This study not only identifies potential therapeutic targets but also offers valuable insights for future drug development in the context of CKD.

Using a wide array of molecular methods, including RNAseq, co-IP, overexpression and functional assays, we explored expression pattern and functionality of NAP1L1 in PLTs, and CD34 + -derived megakaryocytes (MKs). NAP1L1 is expressed in PLTs and MKs. Co-IP experiments revealed that dihydrolipolylysine-residue acetyltransferase (DLAT encoded protein PDC-E2, ODP2) dynamically interacts with NAP1L1. PDC-E2 is part of the mitochondrial pyruvate-dehydrogenase (PDH) multi-enzyme complex, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular respiration, and promoting ATP-synthesis via the respiratory chain. Since altered mitochondrial function is a hallmark of infectious syndromes, we analyzed PDH activity in PLTs from septic patients demonstrating increased activity, paralleling NAP1L1 expression levels. MKs PDH activity decreased following an LPS-challenge. Furthermore, overexpression of NAP1L1 significantly altered the ability of MKs to form proplatelet extensions, diminishing thrombopoiesis. These results indicate that NAP1L1 performs in other than nucleosome-assembly functions in PTLs and MKs, binding a key mitochondrial protein as a potential chaperone, and gatekeeper, influencing PDH activity and thrombopoiesis.",1.

Animals appear to be able to sense impending seismic events. During build-up of stress, electronic charge carriers are activated deep below, called positive holes. Positive holes have unusual properties: they can travel fast and far into and through the surrounding rocks. As they flow, they generate ultralow frequency electromagnetic waves. When they arrive at the Earth surface, they can ionize the air. When they flow into water, they oxidize it to hydrogen peroxides. All these physical and chemical processes can have noticeable effects on animals. Abstract Earthquakes occur when tectonic stresses build up deep in the Earth before catastrophic rupture. During the build-up of stress, processes that occur in the crustal rocks lead to the activation of highly mobile electronic charge carriers. These charge carriers are able to flow out of the stressed rock volume into surrounding rocks. Such outflow constitutes an electric current, which generates electromagnetic (EM) signals. If the outflow occurs in bursts, it will lead to short EM pulses. If the outflow is continuous, the currents may fluctuate, generating EM emissions over a wide frequency range. Only ultralow and extremely low frequency (ULF/ELF) waves travel through rock and can reach the Earth surface. The outflowing charge carriers are (i) positively charged and (ii) highly oxidizing. When they arrive at the Earth surface from below, they build up microscopic electric fields, strong enough to field-ionize air molecules. As a result, the air above the epicentral region of an impending major earthquake often becomes laden with positive airborne ions. Medical research has long shown that positive airborne ions cause changes in stress hormone levels in animals and humans. In addition to the ULF/ELF emissions, positive airborne ions can cause unusual reactions among animals. When the charge carriers flow into water, they oxidize water to hydrogen peroxide. This, plus oxidation of organic compounds, can cause behavioral changes among aquatic animals.",1. Introduction,,3. Results and Discussion,3. Results and Discussion,,4.

Herein, we present the development of anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles for the rapid diagnosis of specific COVID-19 viral antigen or virus via a simple colorimetric change observation within a 5 minute time period. For rapid and highly sensitive identification, surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) was employed using 4-aminothiophenol as a reporter molecule, which is attached to the gold nanoparticle via an Au–S bond. In the presence of COVID-19 antigen or virus particles, owing to the antigen–antibody interaction, the gold nanoparticles undergo aggregation, changing color from pink to blue, which allows for the determination of the presence of antigen or virus very rapidly by the naked eye, even at concentrations of 1 nanogram (ng) per mL for COVID-19 antigen and 1000 virus particles per mL for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped baculovirus. Importantly, the aggregated gold nanoparticles form “hot spots” to provide very strong SERS signal enhancement from anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles via light–matter interactions. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation data indicate a 4-orders-of-magnitude Raman enhancement in “hot spot” positions when gold nanoparticles form aggregates.

Human subjects showed no significant changes in aPTT time, international normalized ratio (INR), or platelet count over baseline measurements. No serious adverse events were observed. In vivo imaging in a mouse model showed a single phase clearance of UFH from the nasal cavity. After 12 h, 3.2% of the administered UFH remained in the nasal cavity, decaying to background levels by 48 h. Conclusions UFH showed no toxic effects for extended daily intranasal dosing in mice as well as humans. The clearance kinetics of intranasal heparin solution from the nasal cavity indicates potentially protective levels for up to 12 h after dosing.

The role of the viral spike glycoprotein (S-protein) has been clearly established in SARS-CoV-2 infection through its capacity to bind to the host cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) and angiotensin-converting enzyme-2. The antiviral strategies targeting these 2 virus receptors are currently under intense investigation. However, the rapid evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 genome has resulted in numerous mutations in the S-protein posing a significant challenge for the design of S-protein-targeted inhibitors. As an example, the 2 key mutations in the S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), L452R, and T478K in the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) confer tighter binding to the host epithelial cells. Marine sulfated glycans (MSGs) demonstrate excellent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 via competitive disruption of the S-protein RBD-HSPG interactions and thus have the potential to be developed into effective prophylactic and therapeutic molecules. In this study, 7 different MSGs were evaluated for their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in a virus entry assay utilizing a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus coated with S-protein of the wild-type (Wuhan-Hu-1) or the Delta (B.1.617.2) strain. Although all tested MSGs showed strong inhibitory activity against both strains, no correlations between MSG structural features and virus inhibition could be drawn. Nevertheless, the current study provides evidence for the maintenance of inhibitory activity of MSGs against evolving SARS-CoV-2 strains.",Introduction,Materials and methods,Results and discussion,Results and discussion,,,Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 wild-type (Wuhan-Hu-1) and Delta (B.1.617.2) strains by marine sulfated glycans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9487896/,

In this project, HS–virus interactions were targeted by a new fucosylated chondroitin sulfate from the sea cucumber Pentacta pygmaea (PpFucCS) in order to block human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) entry into cells. Human foreskin fibroblasts were infected with HCMV in the presence of PpFucCS and its low molecular weight (LMW) fractions and the virus yield at five days post-infection was assessed. The virus attachment and entry into the cells were visualized by labeling the purified virus particles with a self-quenching fluorophore octadecyl rhodamine B (R18). The native PpFucCS exhibited potent inhibitory activity against HCMV specifically blocking virus entry into the cell and the inhibitory activities of the LMW PpFucCS derivatives were proportional to their chain lengths. PpFucCS and the derived oligosaccharides did not exhibit any significant cytotoxicity; moreover, they protected the infected cells from virus-induced lytic cell death. In conclusion, PpFucCS inhibits the entry of HCMV into cells and the high MW of this carbohydrate is a key structural element to achieve the maximal anti-viral effect.

Although structural and mechanical changes to tendon and bone following paralysis and disuse are well understood, there is a pressing need to understand how this unloading affects the bone-tendon interface (enthesis); the location most prone to tears and injury. We therefore elucidated these effects of unloading in the entheses of adult mice shoulders that were paralyzed for 21 days by treatment with botulinum toxin A. Unloading significantly increased the extent of mechanical failure and was associated with structural changes across hierarchical scales. At the millimeter scale, unloading caused bone loss. At the micrometer scale, unloading decreased bioapatite crystal size and crystallographic alignment in the enthesis. At the nanometer scale, unloading induced compositional changes that stiffened the bioapatite/collagen composite tissue. Mathematical modeling and mechanical testing indicated that these factors combined to increase local elevations of stress while decreasing the ability of the tissue to absorb energy prior to failure, thereby increasing injury risk. These first observations of the multiscale effects of unloading on the adult enthesis provide new insight into the hierarchical features of structure and composition that endow the enthesis with increased resistance to failure.",,,,,,,Effects of spaceflight on the muscles of the murine shoulder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6343501/,

While previous findings have demonstrated a change in the gut microbial community structure during spaceflight, specific environmental factors that alter the gut microbiome and the functional relevance of the microbiome changes during spaceflight remain elusive. Methods We profiled the microbiome using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in fecal samples collected from mice after a 37-day spaceflight onboard the International Space Station. We developed an analytical tool, named STARMAPs (Similarity Test for Accordant and Reproducible Microbiome Abundance Patterns), to compare microbiome changes reported here to other relevant datasets. We also integrated the gut microbiome data with the publically available transcriptomic data in the liver of the same animals for a systems-level analysis. Results We report an elevated microbiome alpha diversity and an altered microbial community structure that were associated with spaceflight environment. Using STARMAPs, we found the observed microbiome changes shared similarity with data reported in mice flown in a previous space shuttle mission, suggesting reproducibility of the effects of spaceflight on the gut microbiome. However, such changes were not comparable with those induced by space-type radiation in Earth-based studies. We found spaceflight led to significantly altered taxon abundance in one order, one family, five genera, and six species of microbes. This was accompanied by a change in the inferred microbial gene abundance that suggests an altered capacity in energy metabolism. Finally, we identified host genes whose expression in the liver were concordantly altered with the inferred gut microbial gene content, particularly highlighting a relationship between host genes involved in protein metabolism and microbial genes involved in putrescine degradation. Conclusions These observations shed light on the specific environmental factors that contributed to a robust effect on the gut microbiome during spaceflight with important implications for mammalian metabolism. Our findings represent a key step toward a better understanding the role of the gut microbiome in mammalian health during spaceflight and provide a basis for future efforts to develop microbiota-based countermeasures that mitigate risks to crew health during long-term human space expeditions.

Mice with loss of function mutations in kit receptor ( kit W/W-v ) have no bone marrow adipocytes in tibia or lumbar vertebra. We therefore tested the hypothesis that marrow fat contributes to development of osteopenia by comparing the skeletal response to ovariectomy (ovx) in growing wild type (WT) and bone marrow adipocyte-deficient kit W/W-v mice. Mice were ovx at 4 weeks of age and sacrificed 4 or 10 weeks post-surgery. Body composition was measured at necropsy by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Cortical (tibia) and cancellous (tibia and lumbar vertebra) bone architecture were evaluated by microcomputed tomography. Bone marrow adipocyte size and density, osteoblast- and osteoclast-lined bone perimeters, and bone formation were determined by histomorphometry. Ovx resulted in an increase in total body fat mass at 10 weeks post-ovx in both genotypes, but the response was attenuated in the in kit W/W-v mice. Adipocytes were present in bone marrow of tibia and lumbar vertebra in WT mice and bone marrow adiposity increased following ovx. In contrast, marrow adipocytes were not detected in either intact or ovx kit W/W-v mice. However, ovx in WT and kit W/W-v mice resulted in statistically indistinguishable changes in cortical and cancellous bone mass, cortical and cancellous bone formation rate, and cancellous osteoblast and osteoclast-lined bone perimeters.

To establish the cellular mechanism for the architectural changes, vertebrae were analyzed by histomorphometry 1, 3, and 14 days following irradiation. Marrow cell density decreased within 1 day (67% reduction, p<0.0001), reached a minimum value after 3 days (86% reduction, p<0.0001), and partially rebounded by 14 days (30% reduction, p=0.0025) following irradiation.

There was a strong association between radiation-induced marrow cell death and activation of bone lining cells to express the osteoblast phenotype (Pearson correlation −0.85, p<0.0001). An increase (p=0.004) in osteoclast-lined bone perimeter was also detected with irradiation. A priming dose of γ-radiation (0.5 mGy), previously shown to reduce mortality, had minimal effect on the cellular responses to radiation and did not prevent detrimental changes in bone architecture. Bone marrow transplantation normalized marrow cell density, bone turnover, and most indices of bone architecture following irradiation. In summary, radiation-induced death of marrow cells is associated with 1) a transient increase in bone formation due, at least in part, to activation of bone lining cells, and 2) an increase in bone resorption due to increased osteoclast perimeter.

Since osteoblasts and adipocytes are derived from the same mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) progenitor, adipocyte formation may increase at the expense of osteoblast formation. Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone known to regulate energy and bone metabolism. Leptin deficiency and high-fat diet-induced obesity are associated with increased marrow adipose tissue (MAT) and reduced bone formation. Short-duration studies suggest that leptin treatment reduces MAT and increases bone formation in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice fed a regular diet. Here, we determined the long-duration impact of increased hypothalamic leptin on marrow adipocytes and osteoblasts in ob/ob mice following recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) gene therapy. Eight- to 10-week-old male ob/ob mice were randomized into four groups: (1) untreated, (2) rAAV-Lep, (3) rAAV-green fluorescent protein (rAAV-GFP), or (4) pair-fed to rAAV-Lep. For vector administration, mice were injected intracerebroventricularly with either rAAV-leptin gene therapy (rAAV-Lep) or rAAV-GFP (9 × 10 7 particles) and maintained for 30 weeks. In a second study, the impact of increased hypothalamic leptin levels on MAT was determined in mice fed high-fat diets; ob/ob mice were randomized into two groups and treated with either rAAV-Lep or rAAV-GFP. At 7 weeks post-vector administration, half the mice in each group were switched to a high-fat diet for 8 weeks. Wild-type (WT) controls included age-matched mice fed regular or high-fat diet. High-fat diet resulted in a threefold increase in MAT in WT mice, whereas MAT was increased by leptin deficiency up to 50-fold. Hypothalamic leptin gene therapy increased osteoblast perimeter and osteoclast perimeter with minor change in cancellous bone architecture. The gene therapy decreased MAT levels in ob/ob mice fed regular or high-fat diet to values similar to WT mice fed regular diet. These findings suggest that leptin plays an important role in regulating the differentiation of MSCs to adipocytes and osteoblasts, a process that may be dysregulated by high-fat diet.

Mice are routinely housed at room temperature (18–23°C), a strategy that exaggerates physiological differences in thermoregulation between mice (obligatory daily heterotherms) and humans (homeotherms). The purpose of this investigation was to assess whether housing female mice at thermoneutral (temperature range where the basal rate of energy production is at equilibrium with heat loss) alters bone growth, turnover and microarchitecture. Methods Growing (4-week-old) female C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ mice were housed at either 22 °C or 32°C for up to 18 weeks. Results C57BL/6J mice housed at 22°C experienced a 62% cancellous bone loss from the distal femur metaphysis during the interval from 8–18 weeks of age and lesser bone loss from the distal femur epiphysis, whereas cancellous and cortical bone mass in 32°C-housed mice were unchanged or increased. The impact of thermoneutral housing on cancellous bone was not limited to C57BL/6J mice as C3H/HeJ mice exhibited a similar skeletal response. The beneficial effects of thermoneutral housing on cancellous bone were associated with decreased Ucp1 gene expression in brown adipose tissue, increased bone marrow adiposity, higher rates of bone formation, higher expression levels of osteogenic genes and locally decreased bone resorption.

The present findings indicate that cancellous bone loss in rat lumbar vertebrae during spaceflight is accompanied by increased bone resorption and MAT but no change in bone formation. These findings do not support the hypothesis that increased MAT during spaceflight reduces osteoblast activity or lifespan. However, in the context of ovarian hormone deficiency, bone formation during spaceflight was insufficient to balance increased resorption, indicating defective coupling. The results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that during spaceflight mesenchymal stem cells are diverted to adipocytes at the expense of forming osteoblasts.",Introduction,Materials and methods,Results,Discussion,,,Spaceflight-induced vertebral bone loss in ovariectomized rats is associated with increased bone marrow adiposity and no change in bone formation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515514/,

Endochondral bone formation is an important procedure of growth plate determining the bone growth, where this procedure is also regulated by estrogen and its receptor (ER) signaling pathway. The present study is undertaken to explore the roles of ERs in regulating the different growth patterns in ob/ob mice. In this study, C57BL/6 female mice were used as wild-type (WT) mice; ob/ob mice and WT mice were age-matched fed, and bone length is analyzed by X-ray plain film at the 12 weeks old. We confirm that ob/ob mice have shorter femoral length and longer spine length than WT mice ( p < 0.05). The contrasting expression patterns of chondrocyte proliferation proteins and hypertrophic marker proteins are also observed from the femur and spinal growth plate of ob/ob mice compared with WT mice ( p < 0.01). Spearman’s analysis showed that body length (axial and appendicular length) is positively related to the expression level of ERα in growth plate. Three-week-old female ob/ob mice are randomized divided into three groups: 1) ob/ob + ctrl, 2) ob/ob + ERα antagonist (MPP), and 3) ob/ob + ERβ antagonist (PHTPP). Age-matched C57BL/6 mice were also divided into three groups, same as the groups of ob/ob mice. MPP and PHTPP were administered by intraperitoneal injection for 6 weeks. However, the results of X-ray and H&E staining demonstrate that leptin deficiency seems to disturb the regulating effects of ER antagonists on longitudinal bone growth. These findings suggested that region-specific expression of ERα might be associated with contrasting phenotypes of axial and appendicular bone growth in ob/ob mice. However, ER signaling on longitudinal bone growth was blunted by leptin deficiency in ob/ob mice, and the underlying association between ERs and leptin needs to be explored in future work.",Introduction,Methods and Materials,Results,Discussion,"Discussion Although the contrasting phenotypes in bone of the limb and spine were observed in leptin deficiency mice, the reason and mechanisms remain unclear and need to be explored. The current study provides further evidence for the effects of leptin deficiency on the contrasting phenotypes on axial and appendicular bone growth, in which leptin deficiency results in region-specific expression of ERα at the femoral and vertebral GP in ob/ob female mice. According to the axial and appendicular bone length results, we showed that ob/ob mice have a shorter femur length and a longer spinal length than WT mice. IHC staining results also showed opposite results of proliferative and hypertrophic markers in femoral and spinal GP of ob/ob mice. Expression of ERs using IHC, WB, and qPCR methods demonstrated that femur GP has a lower level of ERα, and spinal GP has a higher level of ERα in ob/ob mice compared with those of WT mice. No differences were observed in the expression of ERβ of ob/ob mice compared with WT mice. Spearman’s analysis showed that body length was positively correlated with the expression level of ERα. Antagonists of ERs showed a different regulatory effect on femur length in WT mice, but blocking different ERs did not present regulatory effects on the skeletal longitudinal growth in ob/ob mice. Taken together, our data suggested that the contrasting phenotypes in bone growth of spine and limb induced by leptin deficiency may partially attribute to region-specific expression of ERα in the femoral and spinal GP. Leptin deficiency also blunted the regulatory effects of ER antagonists on the longitudinal growth in ob/ob mice. Still, the underlying mechanisms of the cross talk between leptin and ER signaling need to be studied in the future. Puberty was the second growth peak in mammals. Except for the secondary sexual characteristics, body longitudinal growth was one of the important markers of the puberty ( 27 ). In addition to the regulation of metabolism and reproduction, leptin was reportedly important for the skeletal bone growth ( 12 ). Recently, leptin deficiency has been shown to lead to a shorter femoral length and a longer vertebrae length compared with WT mice using the 6-month-old and prepubertal female ob/ob mice ( 7 , 28 , 29 ). Supplementation of leptin has been shown to increase femoral length in ob/ob mice, but it could not achieve absolute re-established length as compared with WT mice ( 28 , 30 ). In the present study, we confirmed that leptin deficiency induced a shorter femoral length and a longer vertebrae length in the post-pubertal (12-week old) ob/ob mice compared with WT mice, which suggested that the absence of leptin may be the primary factor for the contrasting growth pattern between limb and spine during the whole life of ob/ob female mice. Previous studies have shown that leptin receptor was expressed in cartilaginous skeletal growth centers, articular cartilage, and osteoblasts ( 31 , 32 ). Our previous study also showed that leptin receptor was expressed in the femur and spinal GP ( 33 ). The in situ expression of leptin receptor at the GP supported that leptin directly affected the GP. GP thickness was an important histological marker for the longitudinal bone growth ( 34 ). Here, we focused on the GPs and found that the femoral GP was thinner than that of WT mice, and the spinal GP was thicker than that of WT mice. Leptin deficiency decreased the proliferative zone and hypertrophic zone height in the femoral GP compared with the WT mice, but the ratio of hypertrophic/proliferative zone was higher in ob/ob mice. The contrasting GP patterns of the femur and vertebrae were in line with the general femoral and spinal length observation. As we know, endochondral ossification was the major process that contributed to skeletal bone longitudinal growth ( 9 ). During this procedural transition from cartilage to bone, the potential abilities of chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy were important for GP thickness and were further responsible for longitudinal bone growth ( 35 ). Chondrocytes in different phases of GP secreted unique matrix proteins. Collagen II and aggrecan were used as the markers of GP cellular proliferation. Meanwhile, collagen X and MMP13 were the typical features of GP hypertrophy ( 36 – 38 ). The results of our study demonstrated that leptin deficiency decreased the expression of extracellular matrix marker proteins in femur GP as compared with those in the WT mice, which was in line with the results of Tuner and colleagues ( 28 ). Interestingly, the extracellular matrix makers were at a higher level in the spinal GP as compared with those in the spinal GP of WT mice and the femur GP of ob/ob mice. Collectively, the results of the extracellular matrix maker expression patterns in femoral and spinal GP support the contrasting phenotypes in bone growth of the limb and spine. To explore the mechanism of this interesting phenomenon, we further focused on the expression of ERs in the femoral and spinal GP. Estrogen was a key hormone in puberty of female mammals, and it was also an important factor that may influence the process of skeletal bone line growth ( 36 ). ERs mediated cellular response of estrogen, and previous studies using different global ER knock-out mouse models have suggested that ERα and ERβ presented opposing effects on longitudinal bone growth in female mice ( 20 , 22 , 39 ). ERβ knock-out adult mice have increased skeletal length compared with WT female mice, while ERα knock-out mice presented decreased longitudinal bone growth ( 20 , 22 ). A previous study has shown that the expression level of ERs (especially ERα) was high at the arcuate nucleus in ob/ob mice ( 40 ). Furthermore, in our previous studies ( 24 , 25 ), there were cross-talk effects between leptin and ERs in vitro . However, no reports have been focused on the expression pattern of ERs located at the spinal and femoral GP in ob/ob mice in vivo . In the present study, our data first showed that the expression level of ERα was lower in the femoral GP of ob/ob mice compared with the WT mice, and the level of ERα was higher in the spinal GP of ob/ob mice compared with WT mice or the femoral GP of ob/ob mice. In addition, there were no significant changes in ERβ located at the femoral and spinal GP. ERα was considered as a growth promoter in the skeletal development ( 20 , 39 ). These interesting findings of our study may partially explain the mechanisms of contrasting phenotypes in bone growth of limb and spine. Low expression of ERα in femoral GP resulted in short limbs, and high expression of ERα in spinal GP resulted in long vertebrae. The expression level of ERα was positively correlated with axial and appendicular bone length according to the results of Spearman’s analysis. Furthermore, ER antagonists were used to determine the role of ERα in regulating the longitudinal bone growth. In line with our previous study ( 23 ), the present data showed that ERα blocking directly resulted in decreasing appendicular longitudinal growth, whereas ERβ blocking led to increasing appendicular longitudinal growth in the WT mice. However, selective ER antagonists did not present regulative effects on the longitudinal growth of the ob/ob mice. Taken together, our results show that leptin deficiency directly induced the different expression patterns of ERα at femoral and vertebral GP and low serum estradiol level in ob/ob mice during puberty, and the regulative effects of ER antagonists were disturbed by the absence of leptin. Given the complex effects of leptin deficiency in regulating the bone growth, more specific mechanisms are needed to be explored. In conclusion, we found that leptin deficiency presented contrasting phenotypes in axial and appendicular growth of ob/ob mice at the end of puberty, with reduced level of proliferative and hypertrophic markers in femoral GP and an increased level of these markers in spinal GP. Furthermore, we first found a significant change of expression of ERα located at femoral and spinal GP (lower in femoral GP and higher in spinal GP as compared with that in WT mice). These findings suggested that region-specific expression of ERα might be associated with the formation of contrasting phenotypes of axial and appendicular bone growth in the ob/ob mice. However, further studies are needed to clarify the relation between ERs and leptin in regulating endochondral ossification.",Data Availability Statement The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material.

Growing, leptin-deficient ob/ob mice exhibit a mild form of osteopetrosis. However, the extent to which the disease is (1) self-limiting and (2) reversible by leptin treatment is unknown. We addressed the first question by performing histomorphometric analysis of femurs in rapidly growing (2-month-old), slowly growing (4-month-old), and skeletally mature (6-month-old) wild type (WT) and ob/ob male mice. Absent by 6 months of age in WT mice, cartilage matrix persisted to varying extents in distal femur epiphysis, metaphysis and diaphysis in ob/ob mice, suggesting that the osteopetrotic phenotype is not entirely self-limiting. To address the second question, we employed hypothalamic recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) gene therapy to restore leptin signaling in ob/ob mice. Two-month-old mice were randomized to one of three groups: (1) untreated control, (2) rAAV-Leptin, or (3) control vector rAAV-green fluorescent protein and vectors injected intracerebroventricularly. Seven months later, rAAV-Leptin-treated mice exhibited no cartilage in the metaphysis and greatly reduced cartilage in the epiphysis and diaphysis. At the cellular level, the reduction in cartilage was associated with increased bone turnover. These findings (1) support the concept that leptin is important for normal replacement of cartilage by bone, and (2) demonstrate that osteopetrosis in ob/ob mice is bone compartment specific and reversible by leptin at skeletal sites capable of undergoing robust bone turnover.",,,,,,,Effects of hypothalamic leptin gene therapy on osteopetrosis in leptin-deficient mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5771473/,

Peripheral actions of leptin occur at lower serum levels of the hormone than central actions because entry of leptin into the central nervous system (CNS) is limited due to its saturable transport across the blood brain barrier (BBB). We performed a study in mice to model the impact of leptin production associated with different levels of adiposity on bone formation and compared the response with well-established centrally-mediated actions of the hormone on energy metabolism. Leptin was infused (0, 4, 12, 40, 140, or 400 ng/h) for 12 days into 6-week-old female ob/ob mice (n=8/group) using sc implanted osmotic pumps. Treatment resulted in a dose-associated increase in serum leptin. Bone formation parameters were increased at EC 50 infusion rates of 7–17 ng/h whereas higher levels (EC 50 , 40–80 ng/h) were required to similarly impact indices of energy metabolism. We then analyzed gene expression in tibia and hypothalamus at dose rates of 0, 12 and 140 ng/h; the latter dose resulted in serum leptin levels similar to WT mice. Infusion with 12 ng/h leptin increased expression of genes associated with Jak/Stat signaling and bone formation in tibia with minimal effect on Jak/Stat signaling and neurotransmitters in hypothalamus. The results suggest that leptin acts peripherally to couple bone acquisition to energy availability and that limited transport across the BBB insures that the growth promoting actions of peripheral leptin are not curtailed by the hormone’s CNS-mediated anorexigenic actions.",,,,,,,Leptin stimulates bone formation in ob/ob mice at doses having minimal impact on energy metabolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5288125/,

Accordingly, circulating levels of neutrophils and pro-inflammatory monocytes decreased in Mrc1 −/− mice together with reduced infiltration of macrophages in the visceral adipose tissue and the liver compared to controls. Liver histological profiling coupled with untargeted proteomic analysis revealed that Mrc1 −/− mice presented decreased liver steatosis and the downregulation of proteins belonging to pathways involved in liver dysfunction.

However, exposure to high-dose radiation can result in irreversible osteopenia, and transfer of heterogeneous cell populations can complicate interpretation of results. The goal of this research was to establish an approach for reconstituting bone marrow using small numbers of purified donor-derived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) without negatively affecting bone metabolism. Gamma-irradiated (9 Gy) WBB6F1 mice were engrafted with bone marrow cells (5 × 10 6 cells) or purified HSCs (3,000 cells) obtained from GFP transgenic mice. In vivo analysis and in vitro differentiation assays performed two months later established that both methods were effective in reconstituting the hematopoietic compartment with donor-derived cells. We confirmed these findings by engrafting C57Bl/6 (B6) mice with bone marrow cells or purified HSCs from CD45.1 B6 congenic mice. We next performed adoptive transfer of purified HSCs (750 cells) into WBB6F1 and radiosensitive Kit W/W-v mice and evaluated the skeleton two months later. Minimal differences were observed between controls and WBB6F1-engrafted mice that received fractionated doses of 2 × 5 Gy. Kit w/wv mice lost weight and became osteopenic after 2 × 5 Gy irradiations but these abnormalities were negligible after 5 Gy irradiation. Importantly, adoptive transfer of wild-type cells into Kit w/wv mice restored normal Kit expression in bone marrow. Together, these findings provide strong evidence for efficient engraftment with purified HSCs after lethal TBI with minimal collateral damage to bone.

We performed two experiments to explore the role of increased leptin in temperature-enhanced accrual of BMAT. First, we supplemented 6-week-old female C57BL/6J (B6) mice with leptin for 2 weeks at 10 µg/d using a subcutaneously implanted osmotic pump. Controls consisted of ad libitum ( ad lib ) fed mice and mice pair fed to match food intake of leptin-supplemented mice. The mice were maintained at 32°C for the duration of treatment. At necropsy, serum leptin in leptin-supplemented mice did not differ from ad lib mice, suggesting suppression of endogenous leptin production. In support, Ucp1 expression in BAT, percent body fat, and abdominal WAT mass were lower in leptin-supplemented mice. Leptin-supplemented mice also had lower BMAT and higher bone formation in distal femur metaphysis compared to the ad lib group, changes not replicated by pair-feeding. In the second experiment, BMAT response was evaluated in 6-week-old female B6 wild type (WT), leptin-deficient ob/ob and leptin-treated (0.3 μg/d) ob/ob mice housed at 32°C for the 2-week duration of the treatment. Compared to mice sacrificed at baseline (22°C), BMAT increased in ob/ob mice as well as WT mice, indicating a leptin independent response to increased temperature. However, infusion of ob/ob mice with leptin, at a dose rate having negligible effects on either energy metabolism or serum leptin levels, attenuated the increase in BMAT. In summary, increased housing temperature and increased leptin have independent but opposing effects on BMAT in mice.",Introduction,Materials and methods,Results,Discussion,"Discussion Food consumption decreased in B6 mice following transfer from room temperature to thermoneutral housing in this and prior studies ( 21 , 22 ). The time course for reduced food consumption was advanced (i.e., occurred earlier) but the magnitude of the decrease was not influenced by leptin supplementation. Compared to ad lib mice, supplementation of B6 mice with leptin had no effect on serum leptin levels measured at necropsy but resulted in lower BAT Ucp1 expression, lower serum CTX, lower abdominal WAT and lower BMAT in metaphysis and diaphysis of the distal femur, and higher bone formation rate in distal femur metaphysis. Pair feeding did not closely replicate the effects of leptin supplementation on B6 mice housed at thermoneutral. Transfer of ob/ob mice from room temperature to thermoneutral resulted in higher abdominal WAT and higher BMAT in distal femur. Finally, treatment of ob/ob mice with low dose leptin reduced the increase in BMAT in distal femur following transfer to thermoneutral housing but did not impact abdominal WAT weight. In the present study, we observed a reciprocal relationship between bone formation rate (increased) and BMAT levels (decreased) in distal femur of B6 mice following leptin supplementation. We and others noted inverse relationships between bone formation and BMAT at various skeletal sites during aging and in response to hypophysectomy, spaceflight, ionizing radiation, high fat diets and chronic heavy alcohol consumption ( 7 – 10 , 14 , 23 , 39 – 42 ). However, as mentioned in the Introduction, a causal association between changes in BMAT levels and bone formation rate has not been demonstrated and there are numerous exceptions to this reciprocal relationship. For example, ovariectomy (ovx) in rats results in increases in osteoblast-lined bone perimeter as well as BMAT, as does increasing housing temperature of mice from room temperature to the thermoneutral range ( 43 ). Furthermore, BMAT was increased and bone formation unchanged in ovx rats following a 14-day spaceflight ( 39 ). Finally, treatment with the bone anabolic hormones fibroblast growth factor or parathyroid hormone increased bone formation in rodents without reducing BMAT ( 14 , 44 ). It remains uncertain as to whether BMAT alters the skeletal response to regulatory factors such as hormones and mechanical loads. Compared to B6 WT mice, adult ob/ob mice have higher BMAT levels. However, hindlimb unloading resulted in cancellous bone loss and changes in bone turnover in ob/ob mice indistinguishable from the skeletal response in B6 WT mice ( 45 ). Female mice housed at thermoneutral have higher BMAT and cancellous bone mass than female mice housed at room temperature but antagonizing accrual of BMAT by treatment with the nonspecific β-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol had minimal effect on bone mass, microarchitecture and turnover ( 31 ). Additionally, in spite of differences in BMAT, inflammation-induced bone loss was similar in distal femur metaphysis of female mice housed at room temperature and at thermoneutral ( 46 ). The receptor tyrosine kinase cKit is required for fat storage in long bones and lumbar vertebra of mice ( 47 , 48 ). Therefore, attenuation of cKit signaling provides a novel approach for investigating the regulation and function of BMAT. Results of studies performed in cKit-deficient Kit W/Wv mice do not exclude the possibility that BMAT influences bone metabolism but do demonstrate that mature bone marrow adipocytes are not required for a negative bone turnover balance following ovx or during simulated microgravity ( 43 , 49 ). Indeed, having normal BMAT levels appeared to attenuate bone loss in distal femur induced by simulated microgravity ( 49 ). A limitation of Kit W/Wv mice is that they have hereditary macrocytic anemia, which could independently influence bone metabolism or alternatively modify the effects of BMAT ( 50 , 51 ). However, adoptive transfer of purified WT (WBB6F1/J) hematopoietic stem cells into Kit W/Wv mice (WT→ Kit W/Wv ) normalized bone marrow Kit expression ( 52 ). Hindlimb unloading resulted in reduced cancellous bone in WT→ Kit W/Wv mice verifying that the BMAT-deficient mice are not protected against hindlimb unloading-induced cancellous bone loss ( 49 ). Taken together, factors such as ckit signaling, mechanical loading, leptin status, sex hormones and aging clearly influence BMAT levels but strong evidence that BMAT is an obligatory regulator of bone turnover balance is largely absent. These null results do not imply that BMAT is unimportant; there is compelling evidence that BMAT plays a role in regulated hematopoiesis ( 1 , 53 – 55 ). Also, marrow adipocytes produce hormones, adipokines and cytokines capable of positive as well as negative effects on bone metabolism ( 1 , 56 – 60 ). In the present study, leptin and pair feeding influenced expression of genes for adipokines (Lep), hormones and growth factors (Fgf2, Fgf10, Agt, Angpt2, Bmp2, Bmp7, Dlk1), cell cycle regulators (Ccnd1, Cdkn1a, Cdkn1b), nuclear hormone receptors (Ppard, Pparg), transcription factors (Jun, Nrob2, Twist1, E2f1, Hes1, Srebf1), and signaling pathways (Sfrp1, Sfrp5, Vdr, Wnt10b, Dkk1, Wnt3a, Wnt5a, Wnt5b, Kfl2, Insr, Irs1). These changes in gene expression in bone marrow may lead to local, systemic or neuronal actions to influence bone metabolism, but definitive evidence for this is lacking. Leptin supplementation (Experiment 1) did not result in an increase in serum leptin levels in B6 mice, when measured at necropsy. We interpret this as evidence that supplemental leptin resulted in a compensatory reduction in endogenous hormone production and an increase in leptin sensitivity. Our conclusion is supported by the observed lower abdominal WAT weight and BAT Ucp1 expression in leptin-supplemented mice compared to ad lib or pair-fed mice and lower BMAT in leptin-supplemented B6 WT as well as leptin-treated ob/ob mice. Down regulation of Lep expression in adipocytes is a potential alternative mechanism to decrease serum leptin levels and there is evidence that this mechanism is induced by hypothalamic leptin gene therapy ( 61 ). However, this alternative mechanism is unlikely because reduced abdominal WAT in the present study was not accompanied by a reduction in Lep expression. It is notable that the reduction in BMAT accrual in leptin-treated ob/ob mice was not accompanied by a parallel decrease in abdominal WAT. This suggests that leptin inhibits BMAT accrual at much lower levels than is required to inhibit WAT accrual, a conclusion supported by dose-response studies where leptin was administered to ob/ob mice ( 35 ). Indeed, administration of leptin at a dose rate of 0.3 μg/d did not increase serum leptin levels above the detection limit of 0.5 μg/ml. Food consumption was lower in leptin-supplemented mice compared to ad lib-fed mice for several days following osmotic pump insertion, but afterwards there was no difference in food intake among treatment groups. We interpret this as further evidence that growing mice fed a normal diet are highly leptin sensitive. In support, partially leptin-deficient heterozygote ob/+ mice adapt to partial leptin deficiency by increasing adipose tissue mass until achieving leptin levels similar to B6 WT mice ( 62 ). Treatment of ob/ob mice with leptin resulted in dose-dependent decreases in appetite ( 35 , 63 ). This finding contrasts with B6 mice fed a high fat diet; when treated with leptin, obese mice exhibit an attenuated response, attributable to leptin resistance ( 64 ). Sympathetic signaling is a positive regulator of non-shivering thermogenesis and the β-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol blunted thermoneutral-associated increases in BMAT and WAT ( 65 ). Thus, leptin and environmental temperature may influence BMAT levels by regulating overlapping pathways. However, it is likely that the actions of leptin on BMAT differ from the adipokine’s positive central nervous system-mediated regulatory effects on non-shivering thermogenesis. It is well established that adipocytes express leptin receptors ( 54 , 66 ). Additionally, treatment with leptin at a dose rate with minimal actions on energy metabolism decreased BMAT and increased bone formation in ob/ob mice ( 35 ). In contrast, mild caloric restriction by pair feeding was associated with an increase in BMAT levels. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that leptin signaling and environmental temperature independently regulate BMAT levels. Thermoneutral housing alters many, but not all, metabolic responses ( 67 – 70 ). Regarding bone, compared to room temperature, thermoneutral housing prevents premature cancellous bone loss, attenuates risperidone-induced trabecular bone loss, has modest effects on cortical response to mechanical loading, and does not impact polyethylene-particle induced osteolysis ( 46 , 71 , 72 ). We have shown that increasing environmental temperature from room temperature to thermoneutral impacts gene expression in WAT and bone ( 65 ). In the present study, performed at thermoneutral, leptin supplementation, but not pair feeding, increased expression of genes important to fat synthesis and turnover in WAT; Acacb (Acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase), Adig (adipogenin), Retn (resistin), Slc2a4 (facilitated glucose transporter member 4, GLUT4), and Srebf1 (Sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1). The findings are consistent with fat mobilization in response to leptin supplementation. Leptin supplementation and pair feeding also altered gene expression in whole tibia. However, there was no overlap in genes differentially expressed in WAT and tibia. In general agreement with treatment-associated differences in bone histomorphometry, there were differences in gene expression between leptin-treated mice and pair-fed or ad lib controls. Taken together, the results suggest that these two leptin target tissues respond differently to the hormone. The present studies were performed in growing female mice and evaluated (1) distal femur metaphysis (histomorphometry), a skeletal site where BMAT is closely associated with cancellous bone undergoing rapid turnover, and (2) whole tibia (gene expression). The present studies do not include controls for age-related changes in BMAT that may have occurred during the 2-week intervention. However, we have previously reported higher levels of BMAT in female mice housed at thermoneutral compared to age-matched controls housed at room temperature and pilot studies revealed no change during the evaluated age range ( 31 , 34 ). Our evaluation of one sex is a study limitation because there are sex differences in bone growth and BMAT accrual ( 21 ). Additionally, adipocyte number differs with skeletal site, suggesting possible differences in regulation and function. Future studies should evaluate the effects of environmental temperature and leptin on BMAT at multiple locations in skeletally mature and aging male and female mice. Furthermore, because energy balance and thermoregulation in mice differs markedly from humans it would be enlightening to investigate the response of BMAT to environmental temperatures in additional model organisms. Our analyses were performed at 4 levels; quantitative histomorphometry, gene expression, serum biomarkers (indices of whole-body bone turnover and fat stores) and organ mass/density. Histomorphometry examined the relationships between bone turnover and BMAT at one cancellous bone site (distal femur metaphysis) in response to treatment. Evaluation of differential expression of a panel of genes related to adipogenesis was used to compare the response to leptin in WAT and whole tibia. The tibia, in addition to adipose tissue (regulated and constitutive BMAT), contains compartment-specific distributions of bone (e.g., cortical and cancellous), cartilage, hematopoietic tissue and other tissues. Differences between our skeletal site in femur and whole tibia preclude direct comparisons between these two long bones. This being said, changes identified in a long bone are generally representative of the appendicular skeleton ( 1 , 31 , 35 , 43 , 47 , 49 , 52 , 62 , 65 ). Serum biomarkers and whole organ measurements were performed as indices of macro changes in response to treatment. In summary, increasing environmental temperature from room temperature to thermoneutral in growing female B6 and ob/ob mice has major effects on body composition, including an increase in BMAT in the distal femur metaphysis in both genotypes and an increase in leptin levels in B6 mice. Administration of leptin lowered BMAT levels in both B6 WT and leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. Based on these findings, we conclude that increases in leptin signaling in leptin-sensitive mice and environmental temperature in normal and leptin-deficient mice have independent but opposite effects on BMAT levels. Specifically, alleviation of cold stress by housing mice at thermoneutral increases BMAT compared to room temperature housing, whereas increasing leptin signaling decreases BMAT.",Data availability statement The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/ Supplementary Materials .

When individually housed at room temperature (~22 °C) mice experience cold stress which results in cancellous bone loss and has the potential to alter the skeletal response to treatment. It is not clear if there is a threshold temperature for cold stress-induced bone loss. It is also not clear if alternative strategies for attenuating cold stress, such as group housing, influence bone accrual and turnover. This study aimed to determine how small differences in temperature (4 °C) or heat loss (individual versus group housing with nestlets) influence bone in growing female C57BL/6 J mice. Five-week-old mice were randomized by weight to 1 of 4 treatment groups (N = 10/group): 1) baseline, 2) single housed at 22 °C, 3) single housed at 26 °C, or 4) group housed (n = 5/cage) with nestlets at 22 °C. Mice in the baseline group were sacrificed 1 week later, at 6 weeks of age. The other 3 groups of mice were maintained at their respective temperatures and housing conditions for 13 weeks until 18 weeks of age. Compared to baseline, mice single housed at room temperature had increased body weight and femur size, but dramatically decreased cancellous bone volume fraction in distal femur metaphysis. The cancellous bone loss was attenuated but not prevented in mice individually housed at 26 °C or group housed at 22 °C. In conclusion, by impacting thermogenesis or heat loss, modest differences in housing conditions could influence experimental results.",,,,,,,Small changes in thermoregulation influence cancellous bone turnover balance in distal femur metaphysis in growing female mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10063413/,

Detection of GFP-positive B and T cells in peripheral blood at 4 and 9 weeks following adoptive transfer and in bone marrow and lymph nodes following necropsy revealed excellent immune reconstitution in both WT and BMAT-deficient mice. Adipocytes were numerous in the distal femur of WT mice but absent or rare in Kit W/W-v mice. Bone parameters, including length, mass, density, bone volume, microarchitecture, and turnover balance, exhibited few differences between WT and BMAT-deficient mice.

The C. elegans body wall muscle is the tissue most directly involved in long-term exercise training and thus we sought to characterize additional aspects of body wall muscle performance and health consequent to exercise. We recently developed a burrowing assay, in which nematodes are stimulated to move through a Pluronic F-127 gel (a hydrogel that transitions from liquid to gel at safe temperatures for C. elegans survival) toward a chemoattractant ( 26 ). We loaded liquid-phase Pluronic F-127 on top of C. elegans in 12-well plates, and allowed the Pluronic F-127 to quickly gel at room temperature, trapping animals under the gel. We then added Escherichia coli OP50-1 on top of the gel, which serves as a food attractant (assay diagram in Fig. 2 A ). In this 3D gel environment, animals with a better neuromuscular performance reach the surface faster and in higher numbers ( 26 ). After a 3+3+2+2 training regimen, Ad5 exercised nematodes reached the gel surface at a significantly higher proportion during the 3-h burrowing assay window as compared to their nonexercised control counterparts ( Fig. 2 B ). Exercised animals have similar chemotactic ability toward E. coli OP50-1 relative to control animals in standard 2D chemotaxis assays on agar plates, supporting similar attraction to OP50-1 ( SI Appendix , Fig. S3 ). The burrowing data constitute an additional line of evidence that long-term swim exercise improves the functional general output of C. elegans body wall muscle. Fig. 2. Long-term swim exercise improves burrowing performance and mitochondrial profiles of body wall muscle. ( A ) Diagram of burrowing assay. After the 3+3+2+2 regimen, we trapped Ad5 animals under a Pluronic F-127 gel and added attractant food E. coli OP50-1 to the center of the gel surface. Animals are attracted by the food and burrow to the surface of the gel at different rates.

One of the hallmarks of endurance exercise in mammals is muscle mitochondrial adaptation, which can be reflected in morphological and functional mitochondrial improvements ( 27 ). We therefore explored the consequences of long-term swim exercise on the body wall muscle mitochondrial network, using a C. elegans strain in which mitochondria are labeled with GFP specifically in the body wall muscle ( P myo-3 mitoGFP ). C. elegans , just like mammals, exhibit a well-described age-related decline in muscle mitochondrial morphology, characterized by increased disorganization and fragmentation of the mitochondrial network ( 12 , 24 , 28 ). We performed confocal imaging of P myo-3 mitoGFP animals at different life stages to establish our own classification system for muscle mitochondrial network health that reflects a progressive increase in fragmentation and disorganization from class 1 (complete mitochondrial coverage of body wall muscle cells and tubular mitochondrial morphology) to class 5 (greatly reduced number of mitochondria and round morphology) ( Fig. 2 C ). After the 3+3+2+2 exercise regimen, we took confocal images of the anterior body wall muscle of P myo-3 mitoGFP animals on Ad5, Ad8, and Ad11, and scored the images blind to exercise condition using the freely available software Blinder ( 29 ). We found that exercised animals exhibited a significant improvement in muscle mitochondrial network organization at all 3 time points tested ( Fig. 2 D ), even though Ad11 corresponds to a full 7 d after the last exercise session. Our results show that long-term swim exercise in C. elegans promotes long-lasting changes in the body wall muscle mitochondrial populations that are correlated with improvements in muscle performance and healthspan.","Long-Term Exercise Improves Whole-Animal Mitochondrial Respiration Parameters. A central question in exercise physiology is the molecular nature of the factors that promote systemic health consequent to exercise. Given that the C. elegans model holds potential for genetic dissection of such health signaling circuits, we turned to focus on assessing animal-wide consequences of exercise for aging adults, with the expectation of defining endpoints that could be used for future mechanistic dissection. In light of the documented benefits of long-term swim exercise to muscle mitochondrial networks, we first sought to determine if mitochondrial function as measured at the whole-animal level was affected by our exercise regimens. To address this question, we analyzed numerous parameters of mitochondrial respiration in whole nematodes by measuring oxygen consumption rates with a Seahorse XFe24 Analyzer. In the Seahorse assays for measuring oxygen consumption rates, basal respiration is first monitored; dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) is then added to inhibit ATP synthase, which reveals relative ATP-linked respiration and distinguishes the residual proton leak; carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) then uncouples mitochondria, collapsing the proton gradient, such that the electron transport chain (ETC) is uninhibited and oxygen consumption by complex IV reaches the maximal rate (the difference between maximal respiration and basal respiration is the spare capacity); addition of sodium azide (a cytochrome c oxidase inhibitor) shuts down all mitochondrial respiration to reveal nonmitochondrial respiration ( 30 ) ( Fig. 3 A ). Fig. 3. Long-term exercise improves mitochondrial respiration parameters and midlife survival. ( A ) Diagram of oxygen consumption rates measured in a Seahorse XFe24 Analyzer consequent to addition of mitochondrial inhibitors, allowing for the calculation of the 6 respiration parameters represented by different colors.

( H ) Survival curve of WT animals exposed to the 3+3+2+2 regimen. n = 221 to 245 animals. * P ≤ 0.05. We swim-exercised C. elegans with the 3+3+2+2 regimen and assayed oxygen consumption rates the following day (Ad5) and 4 d after training (Ad8). We observed no differences between control and exercised animals for basal respiration on both days ( Fig. 3 B ). However, on Ad8, exercised animals exhibited an increase in maximal respiration ( Fig. 3 C ), spare capacity ( Fig. 3 D ), and ATP-linked respiration ( Fig. 3 E ) as compared to nonexercised control counterparts, suggesting a healthier mitochondria population in exercised animals with an improved ability to meet energy requirements under potential challenges of high-energy demand situations. A mild mitochondrial uncoupling by a higher proton leak has been suggested to protect against excessive reactive oxygen species production and oxidative damage in active tissues and organisms ( 31 ). Therefore, the increase in proton leak of exercised animals on Ad5 ( Fig. 3 F ) might be a protective mechanism against excessive oxidative stress during and shortly after the long-term exercise regimen, with the proton leak returning to control levels by Ad8. We observed a decrease in nonmitochondrial respiration of exercised animals on Ad8 relative to nonexercised animals ( Fig. 3 G ). Nonmitochondrial oxygen-consuming processes are not well defined but higher nonmitochondrial respiration has been associated with metabolic stress, inflammation, and damaged mitochondria ( 32 ), suggesting an overall healthier mitochondrial metabolism in Ad8 exercised animals. Muscle gene-expression data after the 4+4+4+4 regimen ( Fig. 1 C ) suggested that 4 swim sessions per day might constitute an excessive exercise training regimen for C. elegans . To get a better sense of exercise consequences, we evaluated the effects of the 4+4+4+4 regimen to mitochondrial respiration parameters ( SI Appendix , Fig. S4 ). Overall, we observed similar trends for the 4+4+4+4 regimen when compared to the 3+3+2+2 regimen, with significant increases in maximal respiration, spare capacity, and ATP-linked respiration of 4+4+4+4 exercised animals. Proton leak was significantly decreased in 4+4+4+4 exercised animals and we found no differences for nonmitochondrial respiration. Importantly, oxygen consumption rates as a whole were significantly lower for the 4+4+4+4 samples relative to the 3+3+2+2 samples (especially on Ad8), indicating that the 4+4+4+4 regimen is stressful for both control and exercised animals and is associated with an overall reduction in mitochondrial health. Taken together, our analyses support that the 3+3+2+2 swim exercise regimen in C. elegans induces both mitochondrial morphological changes (in muscle) and improvements in whole-animal mitochondrial health, with effects that can last for several days after exercise cessation.","Swim exercise in Caenorhabditis elegans extends neuromuscular and gut healthspan, enhances learning ability, and protects against neurodegeneration",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6876156/,

The insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1) pathway is a key mediator of aging in Caenorhabditis elegans and mammals. Specifically, DAF-2 signaling, an ortholog of human IGF, controls DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor, a master regulator of metabolism and longevity. Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are both linked to aging. We propose that daily supplementation of tart cherry extract (TCE), rich in anthocyanins with antioxidant properties may exert dual benefits for mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, resulting in beneficial effects on aging in C. elegans . We found that TCE supplementation at 6 μg or 12 μg/mL, increased ( p < 0.05) the mean lifespan of wild type N2 worms, respectively, when compared to untreated control worms. Consistent with these findings, TCE upregulated ( p < 0.05) expression of longevity-related genes such as daf-16 and aak-2 (but not daf-2 or akt-1 genes) and genes related to oxidative stress such as sod-2 . Further, we showed that TCE supplementation increased spare respiration in N2 worms. However, TCE did not change the mean lifespan of daf-16 and aak-2 mutant worms. In conclusion, our findings indicate that TCE confers healthspan benefits in C. elegans through enhanced mitochondrial function and reduced oxidative stress, mainly via the DAF-16 pathway.",1.

Mitochondrial decline has long been associated with age-related health loss. We show that small, clinically meaningful doses of a mitochondrion-targeting sulfur donor (AP39) extend Caenorhabditis elegans health in older age, which act by maintaining mitochondrial integrity. Adult onset of AP39 delivery, when mitochondrial and cell structural dysfunction are already manifested, also promoted healthy aging. Distinct association of health span extension with mitochondria, cytoskeletal and peroxisome molecular profiles, under regulation of the elt-6 / elt-3 transcription factor regulatory circuit, further distinguished adult-onset AP39 therapy. Our results establish a framework for forward translating mitochondrial sulfide as a potentially viable healthy aging intervention in mammals.",,Materials and Methods,Results,Discussion,"AP39-Mediated Health span Extension Requires H 2 S Metabolism and FoxO Pathways, but Not Nrf2 Oxidative Stress Protection. Several mechanisms have been proposed to regulate longevity in response to exogenous H 2 S ( 19 ), yet the mechanisms governing health span extension are unknown. To probe this, we performed a hypothesis-driven RNAi gene knockdown and a mtH 2 S pharmacogenetic screen, using a microfluidic life span machine to assess animal health every day of the life course. First, we examined the requirement for enzymes controlling endogenous H 2 S synthesis: cytosolic cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS/ cbs-1 ) and cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE/ cth-2 ), and cytoplasmic/mitochondrial 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST/ mpst-1 ) ( 8 – 10 ). Corroborating previous reports, we found that cth-2 knockdown alone had no effect on life span ( 19 ) and knocking down cbs-1 or mpst- 1 shortened life span ( 19 , 44 ) ( SI Appendix , Fig. S4 ). Knockdown of cth-2 also did not significantly affect health span, whereas knockdown of cbs-1 and mpst- 1 RNAi both impaired health span ( SI Appendix , Fig. S4 ). Cotreatment of RNAi against cth-2 , cbs-1 or mpst-1 with mtH 2 S from L1 stage prevented the positive effects of mtH 2 S on life span and health span ( Table 1 and SI Appendix , Fig. S4 ). While exogenous mtH 2 S might be anticipated to bypass endogenous H 2 S biosynthesis pathways, analysis of total animal sulfide levels confirmed a need for functional H 2 S producing enzymes, since mtH 2 S-induced sulfide increases in older age were ablated when combined with cth-2 , mpst-1 or cbs-1 RNAi ( SI Appendix , Fig. S5 ). Combined with the loss of mtH 2 S-induced life span and health span extension with knockdown of the H 2 S synthesizing enzymes kri-1 and cysl-2 ( Table 1 and SI Appendix , Fig. S4 ), the H 2 S synthesis system is a general requirement for the positive effects of mtH 2 S donors on C. elegans health and longevity.

Each experiment was performed in duplicate (total ~160 animals per condition) and health span data expressed as area under the curve (% movement rate of each day of the lifecourse vs. day 0 baseline values). Ticks denote RNAi knockdown prevents significant ( P < 0.05) mtH 2 S life span or health span extension and compared to untreated (0.01% DMSO) empty vector controls. Crosses denote RNAi knockdown does not prevent significant ( P < 0.05) mtH 2 S-induced life span or health span extension. All raw data are provided in SI Appendix , Fig. S4 . We next examined the potential involvement of enzymes involved in wider H 2 S metabolism: ETHE1/ ethe-1 , a mitochondrial sulfur dioxygenase necessary for H 2 S catabolism ( 45 ), and GSR/ gsr-1 , a glutathione reductase involved in H 2 S-mediated production of glutathione ( 46 ). Knockdown of ethe-1 alone did not affect life span but significantly increased health span and, when combined with mtH 2 S, prevented mtH 2 S-induced life span and health span extension. Because ethe-1 catabolizes H 2 S, we postulated that harmful H 2 S accumulation might occur following combined exogenous mtH 2 S administration. Examining the dose response (1nM to 2 µM) of mtH 2 S + ethe-1 knockdown revealed no further decline in animal health span, however life span became shortened at higher (100 nM to 2 µM) doses ( SI Appendix , Fig. S6 ). Both life span and health span were reduced following gsr-1 knockdown, which also inhibited life/health span extension with concurrent mtH 2 S treatment. Additionally, the FoxO/ daf-16 transcription factor has been implicated in H 2 S life span extension ( 19 ), and we observed lowered life span and health span with daf-16 knockdown alone, corroborating previous reports ( 47 ). mtH 2 S did not increase life span or health span in animals subjected to daf-16 RNAi ( Table 1 and SI Appendix , Fig. S4 ). H 2 S also regulated cellular redox homeostasis, in part through activation of the Nrf2 transcription factor and associated signaling pathway ( 48 ). We, therefore, knocked down Nrf2/ skn-1 or DCAF11/ wdr-23 as a negative upstream regulator of Nrf2 ( 49 ). In line with previous reports ( 50 ) skn-1 knockdown animals were short lived, whereas wdr-23 deficient worms were longer lived. Both skn-1 and wdr-23 RNAi also resulted in extended health span. Agreeing with earlier studies showing a need for the Nrf2 system for H 2 S-induced C. elegans life span extension ( 44 ), we also observed prevention of mtH 2 S increases in life span with combined skn-1 or wdr-23 knockdown. Despite this, our findings reveal that the Nrf2 system is not required for mtH 2 S-associated health span extension. We observed this same phenomenon with other components of the Nrf2 pathway, including the Nrf2-controlled glutamate–cysteine ligase catalytic subunit, GCLC/ gcs-1 . Only the Nrf2 nuclear translocation regulatory factor RelA/ ikke-1 attenuated mtH 2 S health span improvements ( Table 1 and SI Appendix , Fig. S4 ). Our data strongly suggest that the positive health span effects of mtH 2 S were not dependent on the Nrf2 signaling system. Last, we investigated the role of two H 2 S-responsive candidates, the mitochondrion-located heat shock protein chaperone HSPA9/ hsp-6 ( 44 ), and the hypoxia inducible transcription factor HIF1A/ hif-1 ( 44 ). Knockdown of both hsp-6 or hif-1 significantly increased life span and health span, and combined gene knockdown with mtH 2 S did not impact the life span and health span promoting effects of mtH 2 S ( Table 1 and SI Appendix , Fig. S4 ).","Adult Treatments with mtH 2 S Extend Health span, but Not Life span. Life span and health span extension have only been previously reported with untargeted H 2 S continuously administered from L1 larval stage until death. We, therefore, treated animals with low (100 nM) dose AP39 or 1000-fold higher (100 µM) dose NaGYY4137, starting in either day 0 young adults, day 2 of adulthood (chosen as the time point of mitochondrial fragmentation onset, Fig. 4 A and ref. 26 ), or day 4 of adulthood [chosen as the time point when tissue structural integrity begins to decline ( 26 )]. Both mtH 2 S and untargeted H 2 S donors were ineffective at increasing animal life span when administered from day 0, 2, or 4 of adulthood ( P > 0.05). Conversely, health span was significantly increased by mtH 2 S when administered from either day 0, 2, or 4 of adulthood ( P < 0.01) and was also increased with untargeted H 2 S treatments starting from days 2 or 4 postadulthood ( P < 0.05), but not in day 0 young adults ( Fig. 4 and SI Appendix , Fig. S7 ). Additionally, mtH 2 S administered from day 0 adulthood significantly increased the number of normally arrayed mitochondria at days 4 and 10 postadulthood, and improved sarcomere organization at day 10 postadulthood ( SI Appendix , Fig. S8 ). Providing further evidence that improved mitochondrial health underpins mtH 2 S health improvements, we also found significantly lower mitochondrial superoxide levels during aging with adult mtH 2 S treatment ( SI Appendix , Fig. S9 ). Health span was thus extended when mtH 2 S was delivered to adult animals, at time points where key aging subcellular defects occur, and is reflected in delayed onset of age-related dystrophic muscle and dysfunctional mitochondria.

Targeted/personalized therapeutics are at the forefront of space medicine strategies, and cross-species molecular signatures now define the ‘typical’ spaceflight response. However, a lack of direct genotype–phenotype associations currently limits the robustness and, therefore, the therapeutic utility of putative mechanisms underpinning pathological changes in flight. Methods: We employed the worm Caenorhabditis elegans as a validated model of space biology, combined with ‘NemaFlex-S’ microfluidic devices for assessing animal strength production as one of the most reproducible physiological responses to spaceflight. Wild-type and dys-1 (BZ33) strains (a Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) model for comparing predisposed muscle weak animals) were cultured on the International Space Station in chemically defined media before loading second-generation gravid adults into NemaFlex-S devices to assess individual animal strength. These same cultures were then frozen on orbit before returning to Earth for next-generation sequencing transcriptomic analysis. Results: Neuromuscular strength was lower in flight versus ground controls (16.6% decline, p < 0.05), with dys-1 significantly more (23% less strength, p < 0.01) affected than wild types. The transcriptional gene ontology signatures characterizing both strains of weaker animals in flight strongly corroborate previous results across species, enriched for upregulated stress response pathways and downregulated mitochondrial and cytoskeletal processes. Functional gene cluster analysis extended this to implicate decreased neuronal function, including abnormal calcium handling and acetylcholine signaling, in space-induced strength declines under the predicted control of UNC-89 and DAF-19 transcription factors. Finally, gene modules specifically altered in dys-1 animals in flight again cluster to neuronal/neuromuscular pathways, suggesting strength loss in DMD comprises a strong neuronal component that predisposes these animals to exacerbated strength loss in space. Conclusions: Highly reproducible gene signatures are strongly associated with space-induced neuromuscular strength loss across species and neuronal changes in calcium/acetylcholine signaling require further study. These results promote targeted medical efforts towards and provide an in vivo model for safely sending animals and people into deep space in the near future.",1. Introduction,2.

PMC10846184,10.1128/spectrum.01144-23,Metabolic model predictions enable targeted microbiome manipulation through precision prebiotics,Microbiology Spectrum,2024,"Marinos, G; Hamerich, I; Debray, R; Obeng, N; Petersen, C; Taubenheim, J; Zimmermann, J; Blackburn, D; Samuel, B; Dierking, K; Franke, A; Laudes, M; Waschina, S; Schulenburg, H; Kaleta, C","ABSTRACT While numerous health-beneficial interactions between host and microbiota have been identified, there is still a lack of targeted approaches for modulating these interactions. Thus, we here identify precision prebiotics that specifically modulate the abundance of a microbiome member species of interest. In the first step, we show that defining precision prebiotics by compounds that are only taken up by the target species but no other species in a community is usually not possible due to overlapping metabolic niches. Subsequently, we use metabolic modeling to identify precision prebiotics for a two-member Caenorhabditis elegans microbiome community comprising the immune-protective target species Pseudomonas lurida MYb11 and the persistent colonizer Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71. We experimentally confirm four of the predicted precision prebiotics, L-serine, L-threonine, D-mannitol, and γ-aminobutyric acid, to specifically increase the abundance of MYb11. L-serine was further assessed in vivo , leading to an increase in MYb11 abundance also in the worm host. Overall, our findings demonstrate that metabolic modeling is an effective tool for the design of precision prebiotics as an important cornerstone for future microbiome-targeted therapies. IMPORTANCE While various mechanisms through which the microbiome influences disease processes in the host have been identified, there are still only few approaches that allow for targeted manipulation of microbiome composition as a first step toward microbiome-based therapies. Here, we propose the concept of precision prebiotics that allow to boost the abundance of already resident health-beneficial microbial species in a microbiome. We present a constraint-based modeling pipeline to predict precision prebiotics for a minimal microbial community in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans comprising the host-beneficial Pseudomonas lurida MYb11 and the persistent colonizer Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71 with the aim to boost the growth of MYb11. Experimentally testing four of the predicted precision prebiotics, we confirm that they are specifically able to increase the abundance of MYb11 in vitro and in vivo . These results demonstrate that constraint-based modeling could be an important tool for the development of targeted microbiome-based therapies against human diseases.",INTRODUCTION,MATERIALS AND METHODS,RESULTS,DISCUSSION,"DISCUSSION Although many factors are known to influence microbiome composition [e.g., dietary patterns, lifestyle, or medication ( 61 )], the mechanisms causing these changes are often not fully understood and often a large number of bacterial species are affected. We propose that the most effective way to modulate the composition of the microbiome is by modulating or enriching the abundance of an already existing bacterial species with health-beneficial effects using precision prebiotics. A direct approach to identify such precision prebiotics would be to provide compounds that are uniquely taken up by the bacterial target species. However, through an analysis of C. elegans and human microbiome data, we were able to show that such unique uptake compounds typically only exist for few species in a microbial community and especially for larger communities there are no such compounds at all. Thus, in a typical microbiome, precision prebiotics have to be identified from compounds that are potentially taken up by several species. To identify such compounds, we used genome-scale metabolic networks of two bacterial members from the C. elegans microbiome, O. vermis MYb71, and the host-protective P. lurida MYb11, in conjunction with constraint-based modeling to identify compounds that specifically increased the growth of MYb11. Using HMDB annotation ( 46 ), we found that fatty acids were enriched as predicted growth-supporting compounds for MYb11 which is in agreement with previous observations of the preference of bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas for these compounds ( 62 ). Considering compounds that were identified across all three simulation approaches and cross-referencing with Biolog data revealed that 4-hydroxybenzoate, D-mannitol, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycerol-3-phosphate, L-serine, trehalose, L-threonine, and putrescine are potential precision prebiotics for MYb11. We experimentally tested four of these predicted compounds, L-serine, L-threonine, D-mannitol, and GABA in vitro and confirmed their positive effect specifically on the growth of MYb11. Moving into the C. elegans host system, we were able to show that L-serine is also able to selectively boost the abundance of MYb11 in vivo , when the host was colonized with both bacterial species. Interestingly, while 10 mM of L-serine was sufficient for an enrichment of MYb11 in batch culture, 100 mM was necessary in the growth experiments with the host. This suggests differences in either bacterial uptake kinetics for L-serine or bacterial growth in general between batch growth and growth on agar plates. Moreover, while MYb11 was strongly enriched in worms to similar levels like MYb71 even though it had a very low abundance in the lawn, this enrichment was even stronger when supplying L-serine. Thus, our proof-of-principle work demonstrates that constraint-based microbial community modeling approaches are an effective tool for the future development of targeted microbiome therapies using precision prebiotics. The effect of serine and threonine on the host and/or on its microbiome has been also documented in the literature. For instance, threonine is an essential amino acid for the host ( 59 ). Longevity effects on the host have been shown also after supplementation with threonine ( 63 ) and serine ( 57 ), while dietary serine reduced host fitness through acting on bacterial metabolism, when it was supplemented along with the chemotherapeutic 5-fluoro 2′deoxyuridine ( 60 ). Moreover, serine promotes the growth of E. coli LF82 in the mouse gut ( 64 ), which shows the potential of this compound to alter the abundance of multiple species. In accordance, we also observed the effects of serine on MYb71 growth, which was, however, stronger for MYb11 if they were grown in community. One important challenge to specifically target the microbiome with nutritional supplements is to prevent host uptake or metabolization of the supplements ( 65 ). Different approaches to achieve restricted bioavailability, such as the supplementation of non-digestible carbohydrates ( 66 ) or coating of supplements with compounds that dissolve during passage through the digestive tract have been developed ( 67 – 69 ). Moreover, as indicated by our analysis of concentration-dependent effects of supplementation in the case of serine, it might be necessary to control the specific concentrations of a compound that are being released and their stability over time in the gut. From the bacterial side, Biolog assays have shown that MYb11 has the capacity to catabolize serine ( Fig. 2D ). However, the specific concentrations used on the Biolog plates and the mechanisms of transport that are possibly dependent on those concentrations are not known. From the host side, to maintain relatively constant concentrations in the host environment or to deviate from its normal concentrations, advanced formulations such as nanotechnology ( 70 ), delayed release, and other drug delivery technologies ( 71 , 72 ) could be employed. Although our combined computational-experimental approach can serve as a blueprint for future studies aimed at the identification of precision prebiotics, several factors should still be taken into consideration. As we showed, it is nearly impossible to identify a compound that is uniquely taken up by only one species within a community. This point becomes apparent, if we consider the numerous different species that reside in various hosts. For instance, the synthetic bacterial community of C. elegans , CeMbio ( 24 ) has 12 members, while the human-related bacterial community AGORA has more than 800 species ( 34 ). Thus, an important next step is to scale up our approach to more complex communities. Also along these lines, we did use automatically reconstructed bacterial metabolic networks from our gapseq approach rather than manually curated networks which resembles the typical situation in the human gut microbiota where a detailed manual reconstruction of the hundreds to thousands of already detected and sequenced bacterial species is practically impossible. Furthermore, since the physiology of worms cannot be directly compared to the physiology of humans, the efficacy and effectiveness of the approach [see more on the topic ( 73 )] need to be studied in more detail. At this point, the complexity of the regulatory affairs in various jurisdictions (e.g., the definition of nutritional supplementation vs medication, safety concerns) should also not be underestimated ( 74 ). Additionally, while the modeling approach we used has quite a number of underlying assumptions, it allowed us to considerably narrow down the list of potential candidate metabolites for experimental testing. Finally, we did not consider potential side effects of the supplemented metabolites on the worm host and did not optimize the mode of delivery, for instance, to release the supplement specifically in the worm gut, which are important considerations for future studies. Taking everything into consideration, we showed that the in silico design of targeted supplementation strategies to modulate the microbiome is not only feasible but also promising for the development of future microbiome-based treatment.",,Metabolic model predictions enable targeted microbiome manipulation through precision prebiotics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10846184/,

PMC11302229,10.1128/spectrum.00169-24,Identification and characterization of a skin microbiome on Caenorhabditis elegans suggests environmental microbes confer cuticle protection,Microbiology Spectrum,2024,"Haghani, N; Lampe, R; Samuel, B; Chalasani, S; Matty, M","ABSTRACT In the wild, C. elegans are emersed in environments teeming with a veritable menagerie of microorganisms. The C. elegans cuticular surface serves as a barrier and first point of contact with their microbial environments. In this study, we identify microbes from C. elegans natural habitats that associate with its cuticle, constituting a simple “skin microbiome.” We rear our animals on a modified CeMbio, mCeMbio, a consortium of ecologically relevant microbes. We first combine standard microbiological methods with an adapted micro skin-swabbing tool to describe the skin-resident bacteria on the C. elegans surface. Furthermore, we conduct 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies to identify relative shifts in the proportion of mCeMbio bacteria upon surface-sterilization, implying distinct skin- and gut-microbiomes. We find that some strains of bacteria, including Enterobacter sp. JUb101 , are primarily found on the nematode skin, while others like Stenotrophomonas indicatrix JUb19 and Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71 are predominantly found in the animal’s gut. Finally, we show that this skin microbiome promotes host cuticle integrity in harsh environments. Together, we identify a skin microbiome for the well-studied nematode model and propose its value in conferring host fitness advantages in naturalized contexts. IMPORTANCE The genetic model organism C. elegans has recently emerged as a tool for understanding host–microbiome interactions. Nearly all of these studies either focus on pathogenic or gut-resident microbes. Little is known about the existence of native, nonpathogenic skin microbes or their function. We demonstrate that members of a modified C. elegans model microbiome, mCeMbio, can adhere to the animal's cuticle and confer protection from noxious environments. We combine a novel micro-swab tool, the first 16S microbial sequencing data from relatively unperturbed C. elegans , and physiological assays to demonstrate microbially mediated protection of the skin. This work serves as a foundation to explore wild C. elegans skin microbiomes and use C. elegans as a model for skin research.",INTRODUCTION,MATERIALS AND METHODS,RESULTS,DISCUSSION,"MATERIALS AND METHODS C. elegans strains and maintenance Strains were ordered from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center and include the following: wild-type N2; CB130 dpy-8 (e130 ); VC2985 dpy-10 (gk3075 ) II; CB6627 srf-3 (e2689 ) IV; CB6177 bus-8 (e2883 ) X. All animals were grown at 20°C under standard conditions to adulthood ( 52 ). NGM plates were seeded with either E. coli OP50 or mCeMbio strains, unless noted of a specific bacterium. For all experiments, L4 animals are placed on lawns and removed ~12 hours later, leaving only offspring behind. Experiments are then performed on the offspring, unless otherwise noted. Culture and maintenance of mCeMbio bacteria Individual isolates of “CeMBio” bacteria, referred to as mCeMbio (gift from H. Schulenberg, available now through CGC as CeMbio, see note below in Identification of mCeMbio) and CBX151 (a gift from Marie-Anne Félix), were streaked onto LB agar plates, and individual colonies were picked and grown in LB growth media. Individual bacteria (12 mCeMbio strains, CBX151, and OP50) were allowed to grow for 2–4 days, with shaking at 4 x g at 20°C. Bacteria were maintained and prepared to OD 600 = 0.2 by dilution in additional LB or centrifuging at 1,800 x g for 5 minutes to remove excess LB to increase the concentration of slow-growing isolates. To make mCeMbio, each of the 12 bacteria were combined at equal ratios. Two hundred microliters of the bacteria was pipetted on 6-cm NGM plates and evenly spread across the agar plate using a sterile L spreader (VWR 490007–358). Bacterial plates were left to dry in a laminar flow hood for 2 days. If not used immediately, seeded plates were stored at 4°C. We maintain glycerol stocks of each bacterium at −80°C, and these were used for each new batch of each mCeMbio strain, OP50, or CBX151 bacteria. Identification of mCeMbio strain JUb101 The Lelliottia amnigena, JUb66, genome sequenced in Houston by Buck Samuel’s group and the JUb66 genome sequenced in Kiel by Heinrich Schulenburg’s group are different. The bacterial sample deposited at the CGC as part of the CeMbio consortium is the JUb66 from the Samuel Lab (JUb66 Houston), and the one from the Schulenburg lab is now known as JUb101. We acquired our strains from the Schulenburg lab. These two genomes have identical 16S rRNA representative sequences and the same number of 16S repeats. A whole-genome comparison of JUb66 Houston and JUb101 (formerly known as JUb66 Kiel) shows only 84% similarity. To determine the identity of our CeMbio strain, formerly known as JUb66 Kiel, we used the following PCR primers and standard NEB Taq protocols. JUb66-2270F TTGCTTCGGGTGGTGGTATC JUb66-2827R CCATGGAACTCACCCCTGTC JUb101-1377F GAGGATGGGTATGCAGACCG JUb101-2375R GGGATCGCAATCTGACGGAT Therefore, we call our mixture mCeMbio, a modified CeMbio consortium. C. elegans and bacterial prep for DNA extraction Animals were reared on mCeMbio bacterial lawns for 48–82 hours after hatching. Bacterial plates ( n = 3 for each group) were flooded with M9 and 30 animals were picked off with a glass pipette and placed into an Eppendorf tube. For unbleached animals, tubes were washed with M9 +T [M9 +25 mM tetramisole hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich L9756)] five times, allowing 4 minutes for animals to sink to the bottom of the tubes between each wash. For bleached animals, tubes were washed with M9 +T two times and then washed with surface-sterilizing bleaching solution (M9 +T + 2.5% hypochlorite +1M KOH) for 4 minutes. These tubes were rinsed with M9 +T twice for 4 minutes each. After washes, animals were allowed to sink to the bottom of the tube. All but 100 µL of media was removed in the final wash, and the tubes were frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C. For “lawn” plates, 1 mL of M9 was added to the plate, and the bacterial lawns were scraped with a sterile L spreader (VWR 490007–358). Bacterial slurry was pipetted and centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 4 minutes. All but 100 µL was removed, and the pellet was frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C. DNA was extracted following the standard NucleoSpin Tissue Kit (Macherey-Nagel 740952) protocol for animal tissue with 1 hour of incubation for the first lysis step. DNA was stored at −20°C. 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and analysis For each experiment, an amplicon library targeting the V4–V5 hypervariable region of the 16S gene was generated via one-step PCR using the Azura TruFi DNA Polymerase PCR kit, and the 515 F (GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and 926R (CCGYCAATTYMTTTRAGTTT) primer set was used ( 53 ). Each reaction was performed with an initial denaturing step at 95°C for 1 minute, followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds, 56°C for 15 seconds, and 72°C for 30 seconds. Two and a half microliters of each PCR reaction was run on a 1.8% agarose gel to confirm amplification. PCR products were purified using Beckman Coulter AMPure XP following the standard 1 x PCR clean-up protocol. PCR quantification was performed in duplicate using the Invitrogen Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay kit. Samples were then pooled in equal proportions (20 ng DNA per sample), followed by another AMPure XP PCR purification. The final libraries were evaluated on an Agilent 2200 TapeStation (D1000 ScreenTape), quantified with the Qubit HS dsDNA kit, and each library was sequenced at the University of California, San Diego IGM Genomics Center on a single Illumina MiSeq lane with a 25% PhiX spike-in. Amplicons were analyzed with QIIME2 v2019.10 ( 54 ). Briefly, demultiplexed paired-end reads were trimmed to remove adapter and primer sequences with cutadapt ( 55 ). Trimmed reads were then denoised with DADA2 to produce amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) ( 56 ). Taxonomic annotation of ASVs was conducted with the q2-feature-classifier classify-sklearn naïve-bayes classifier ( 57 , 58 ), both the genome-derived reference 16S sequences of CeMbio strains ( 33 ) and the SILVA database (v138) ( 59 ). ASVs were then aggregated by the bacterial strain, and reads were normalized by the 16S gene copy numbers estimated by their genome assemblies ( 33 ). Bray–Curtis dissimilarities, Shannon indices, and tests of statistical significance were then calculated with the QIIME2 diversity plugin on the normalized relative abundance count data ( 60 , 61 ). Raw sequence data are deposited in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under the BioProject accession PRJNA979901 . Data are sorted into experiment 1 and experiment 2 “combine,” in which all wild-type, hermaphrodite samples, regardless of date of extraction or age, were included if they met the category “bleached” or “unbleached” (serially washed). These data are displayed in Fig. 2 and sorted by experiment. Fig. S2 displays data from combining experiment 1 and experiment 2, but only the samples in which the bleached and unbleached (serially washed) samples were prepared as a matched set on the same day and at day 1 of adulthood. Skin-swabbing with the 96-well plate assay To prepare the micro-swab, a glass capillary tube (World Precision Instrument Thin Wall Glass Capillaries-TW100-4 or similar) was pulled apart over a small flame into two pieces. Heat was used to create a small closed bulb at the pulled end of each piece, ensuring there were no crevices in which bacteria or liquids may accumulate, and then the glass was allowed to cool. Then, using 600-grain sandpaper, the bulb was lightly scored to make a textured surface (~10 small circles on each side and tip). To sterilize, the swab is dipped in 70% ethanol and air-dried. To swab a lawn, the micro-swab is dipped into the lawn on which the animals were reared and then immediately swirled in the appropriate LB-containing wells. To swab an animal with the condition “crawl,” a single animal is placed on an empty NGM agar plate using an eyelash pick and allowed to crawl for 30 seconds. Using a dissecting microscope, the animal was gently swabbed using the bulbous end from head to tail 10 times. The bulb was then dipped and swirled around in 10 circles into 200 µL of LB in a 96-well plate (CoStar 96 Flat Black). Animals that were washed once “1 x wash” were washed in M9 +T and allowed to sink to the bottom of a tube. This was repeated two more times for “3 x wash.” For animals in the “bleach” group, they were first washed with M9 +T three times, then once with surface-sterilizing bleaching solution (M9 +T + 2.5% hypochlorite +1M KOH), and once more with M9 +T. Once washed or bleached, the animals were then pipetted onto a sterile NGM plate in a small volume and allowed to crawl out of the drop before being swabbed. Once all animals were swabbed, the OD 600 was measured using a Molecular Devices SpectraMaxPlus with absorbance = 600 nm, manually taking measurements during standard work hours. To generate the curves in Fig. 1D, F and 3B, D and F ,Fig. S1A through D and Fig. S3A through F, the individual replicate OD 600 values at each timepoint were averaged in each condition within an experiment. Our methods make use of area under the curve analyses, which can be used to compare and quantify data from multiple growth curves ( 62 , 63 ). Colony-Forming Unit assay Animals were reared to day 1 of adulthood on chosen bacteria. Fifty adult worms were transferred to a 2-mL tube containing 100 µL M9 and 10–20 1 mm zirconium beads (Beadbug Z763780). Each tube of worms was washed three times for 3 minutes each with 750 µL M9 +tetramisole (25 mM), removing all but 100 µL liquid with a new pipette tip each time, allowing animals to sink to the bottom of the tube by gravity. We separated half of the tubes to be “bleached” groups, which are subjected to a 4-minute wash with surface-sterilizing bleaching solution (M9 +T + 2.5% hypochlorite +1M KOH). Bleached animals are washed for 3 minutes x 2 using M9-T to remove the bleach. On the final wash, 100 µL of the supernatant from each bleached tube is removed. Unbleached samples are washed for 3 minutes x 2 using M9-T, and 100 µL of the supernatant is removed for each unbleached tube. Each sample is homogenized using a Fisher Mixer Mill at Level 4 for 30 seconds for four cycles, totaling 2 minutes of bead beating. The homogenate was then serially diluted (1 in 100, 1000, 10000, and 100000 for each tube of 50 worms) in M9. One hundred microliters of each dilution was plated and spread with a sterile L spreader on LB agar plates. The previously removed supernatants were also diluted in M9 and plated. Plates were dried and left to grow for 48 hours. Finally, bacterial colonies were counted to quantify the original bacterial colony counts in each sample (unbleached, bleached, and supernatant of both bleached and unbleached samples). Cuticle fragility assay Fifteen microliters of strong bleach solution (1M KOH and ~5% hypochlorite) is pipetted onto a single day 1 adult animal after it has crawled on a clean NGM plate for ~10 seconds. Under a dissecting microscope, the time to burst open (cuticle loses integrity) is recorded. Standard statistical analyses Fig. 1, 3, 4 ; Fig. S1 to S4 and their statistical analyses were completed in GraphPad Prism. Ungrouped two-sample t -tests were used when determining the statistical significance during comparisons of two groups. With three groups and more, an ANOVA test was performed for determining significance values. When appropriate, corrections were performed for multiple comparisons or unequal variances. Any P value smaller than 0.05 was considered significant.

In this study, pre-PCR propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment was coupled with downstream pyrosequencing and PhyloChip DNA microarray analyses to better understand the frequency, diversity and distribution of viable bacteria in spacecraft assembly cleanrooms. Sample fractions not treated with PMA, which were indicative of the presence of both live and dead cells, yielded a great abundance of highly diverse bacterial pyrosequences.

The primary goal of this study was to characterize the viable microbiome of the ISS-built environment. A second objective was to determine if the built environments of Earth-based cleanrooms associated with space exploration are an appropriate model of the ISS environment. Results Samples collected from the ISS and two cleanrooms at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, Pasadena, CA) were analyzed by traditional cultivation, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and propidium monoazide–quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PMA-qPCR) assays to estimate viable microbial populations. The 16S rRNA gene Illumina iTag sequencing was used to elucidate microbial diversity and explore differences between ISS and cleanroom microbiomes. Statistical analyses showed that members of the phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria were dominant in the samples examined but varied in abundance. Actinobacteria were predominant in the ISS samples whereas Proteobacteria, least abundant in the ISS, dominated in the cleanroom samples. The viable bacterial populations seen by PMA treatment were greatly decreased. However, the treatment did not appear to have an effect on the bacterial composition (diversity) associated with each sampling site. Conclusions The results of this study provide strong evidence that specific human skin-associated microorganisms make a substantial contribution to the ISS microbiome, which is not the case in Earth-based cleanrooms. For example, Corynebacterium and Propionibacterium (Actinobacteria) but not Staphylococcus (Firmicutes) species are dominant on the ISS in terms of viable and total bacterial community composition. The results obtained will facilitate future studies to determine how stable the ISS environment is over time. The present results also demonstrate the value of measuring viable cell diversity and population size at any sampling site. This information can be used to identify sites that can be targeted for more stringent cleaning. Finally, the results will allow comparisons with other built sites and facilitate future improvements on the ISS that will ensure astronaut health.

Since built environments are known to have specific microbiomes [ 6 ], it is of the highest interest to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scientific community to explore the environmental microbiome of the ISS as a closed environment. Moreover, the National Research Council (NRC) specifically recommended that NASA study changes in microbial populations in response to selective pressure associated with microgravity, which characterizes life aboard the ISS [ 7 ]. Previous studies show that permanent changes have occurred within the microbial species during experiments aboard the ISS [ 8 , 9 ]. Although next-generation sequencing (NGS) analyses are now broadly implemented in many microbiology-related scientific fields, especially in microbial ecology [ 10 , 11 ] and human microbiome projects [ 12 , 13 ], use of these techniques for closed habitats has just begun [ 14 ] and warrants more research. “Deep” sequencing of ISS samples can answer questions on abundance and diversity of the microorganisms. However, differentiating viable and yet-to-be-cultivable microbial populations requires an appropriate sample processing technology [ 15 ]. The use of the reagent propidium monoazide (PMA) before DNA extraction eliminates cells with a compromised membrane. The PMA-based assay thus allows for a more accurate approximation of the viable microbial community in terms of richness as well as abundance [ 15 ]. Due to the technically rigorous methods required for culturing many microorganisms, characterization of human-associated microbial populations in the ISS environment remains a significant challenge. However, it is important to monitor the presence of any opportunistic pathogenic microorganisms. As long-duration human missions are planned in the future, detection of human pathogens and possible mitigation practices must be developed. In addition, understanding of the ISS microbiome could facilitate the necessary maintenance of this closed habitat and thereby assist in preventing degradation of its components by some microorganisms [ 4 ]. Both ISS environment and cleanrooms on Earth are maintained by high-efficiency particulate arrestance (HEPA) filters. Importantly, considerable prior knowledge of the microbial communities associated with these cleanrooms exists from prior studies. The ISS has been exposed to these communities indirectly by the fact that some of the cargos sent to the ISS were packaged in these specific NASA cleanrooms. As in the case of the ISS closed habitat, the Earth-based cleanrooms are controlled for humidity, temperature, and circulation. Furthermore, NASA quality assurance engineers perform periodic audits to ensure that certified-facility cleanliness levels conform to the requirements delineated for both the ISS and Earth cleanrooms. The ISS environment is zero gravity with exposure to space radiation and elevated carbon dioxide levels. By necessity the air is re-circulated whereas on Earth the cleanrooms are constantly replenished with fresh air. An important difference is human habitation, which does not occur in the Earth cleanrooms. However, the human traffic in Earth cleanrooms is actually rather high (at least 50+ people in a given working day) when compared to the ISS where only 6 astronauts are allowed at a single time. This study is the first to analyze samples from the ISS air and surface using the traditional (colony counts [i.e., cultivable bacteria]) and state-of-the-art molecular techniques (adenosine triphosphate [ATP] and quantitative polymerase chain reaction [qPCR] assays) to measure the abundance of microorganisms (i.e., live and dead cells). Furthermore, the abundance and diversity of viable bacterial community were assessed using molecular methods (PMA treatment followed by qPCR [i.e., bacterial burden] or Illumina-based 16S rRNA sequencing [i.e., microbial diversity]). Additionally, the microbial diversity of the ISS was compared with samples from Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) spacecraft assembly facility (SAF) cleanrooms, which also represent closed and environmentally controlled built ecosystems.",Methods,Results,Discussion,,Conclusions,Microbiomes of the dust particles collected from the International Space Station and Spacecraft assembly facilities,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4624184/,

The ILMAH was primarily commissioned to measure physiological, psychological, and immunological characteristics of human inhabiting in isolation, but it was also available for other studies such as examining its microbiological aspects. Characterizing and understanding possible changes and succession of fungal species is of high importance since fungi are not only hazardous to inhabitants but also deteriorate the habitats. Observing the mycobiome changes in the presence of human will enable developing appropriate countermeasures with reference to crew health in a future closed habitat. Results Succession of fungi was characterized utilizing both traditional and state-of-the-art molecular techniques during the 30-day human occupation of the ILMAH. Surface samples were collected at various time points and locations to observe both the total and viable fungal populations of common environmental and opportunistic pathogenic species. To estimate the cultivable fungal population, potato dextrose agar plate counts method was utilized. The internal transcribed spacer region-based iTag Illumina sequencing was employed to measure the community structure and fluctuation of the mycobiome over time in various locations. Treatment of samples with propidium monoazide (PMA; a DNA intercalating dye for selective detection of viable microbial populations) had a significant effect on the microbial diversity compared to non-PMA-treated samples. Statistical analysis confirmed that viable fungal community structure changed (increase in diversity and decrease in fungal burden) over the occupation time. Samples collected at day 20 showed distinct fungal profiles from samples collected at any other time point (before or after). Viable fungal families like Davidiellaceae , Teratosphaeriaceae , Pleosporales , and Pleosporaceae were shown to increase during the occupation time. Conclusions The results of this study revealed that the overall fungal diversity in the closed habitat changed during human presence; therefore, it is crucial to properly maintain a closed habitat to preserve it from deteriorating and keep it safe for its inhabitants. Differences in community profiles were observed when statistically treated, especially of the mycobiome of samples collected at day 20. On a genus level Epiccocum , Alternaria , Pleosporales , Davidiella , and Cryptococcus showed increased abundance over the occupation time.

An inflatable lunar/Mars analog habitat (ILMAH) is a unique, simulated closed environment (isolated by HEPA filtration) that can be utilized to overcome challenges associated with both technical and scientific issues [ 3 ]. Because the ILMAH mimics International Space Station (ISS) conditions and is treated as a prototype habitat for future space explorations, microbiological characteristics of such a closed environment is of high interest to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The environmentally controlled ILMAH is an easily accessible system that enables samples to be collected and analyzed at multiple times at relatively low cost. Understanding the microbiome of a closed system and its association with human inhabitation will help to assess the correlation between human health and microbiome of the habitat as well as the influence of microorganism on the habitat deterioration [ 4 – 6 ]. The highly specialized structure of the simulated ILMAH keeps its inhabitants in isolation from the outside environment. Except for the exchange of the air between outdoor and indoor environments via an advanced environmental control system, the ILMAH mimics the ISS and other future habitats of human explorers on the other planets [ 3 ]. This unique feature of the ILMAH allows observing the changes in the microbiome during human occupation. The bacteriome of the ILMAH was recently reported [ 7 ], as in the case of most of the studies reporting on bacterial microbiomes [ 8 ]. The molecular fungal diversity of Japanese Experimental Module—Kibo, on the ISS, revealed abundance of fungi associated with astronauts, but succession of viable fungal population in their habitat was not addressed [ 9 ]. The skin fungal microbiota of 10 Japanese astronauts showed temporal changes before, during, and after their stay on the ISS. The molecular fungal diversity associated with various body parts was reduced during the spaceflight when compared to pre-flight data. However, the ratio of Malassezia genetic signatures to all fungal gene copies (including dead fungal cells) increased during their stay at the ISS—but the viability of these fungi was not confirmed [ 10 ]. This is the first report that thoroughly characterizes the mycobiome of a simulated habitat meant for the future human habitats on other planets. Utilization of next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques enables more in-depth analysis of indoor microbiomes [ 11 ]. Many studies focus on the bacterial microbiome of intensive care units [ 8 , 12 – 14 ], pharmaceutical clean rooms [ 15 – 17 ], or tissue banks [ 18 ] since their microbial composition has an impact on human health and life. Nosocomial infections acquired in hospitals and other health care facilities remain the sixth leading cause of death in the hospitals in USA [ 19 , 20 ]. Nosocomial infections are mostly caused by various fungal species that belong to the Candida genus and filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus [ 21 – 23 ]. Therefore, it remains important to screen future closed habitats for the presence of opportunistic pathogens that can affect health of immunocompromised astronauts. So far, majority of the indoor microbiome studies have focused on the bacterial microbiome without analyzing the mycobiome. In addition, those few studies that characterized fungi of indoor environments focused on culture-based populations [ 24 – 27 ]. In those cases, where new molecular techniques were implemented [ 28 – 31 ] viable fungi were not differentiated from the total population (viable and dead) [ 32 ]. The internal transcribed spacer region-based iTag Illumina sequencing coupled with the propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment used in this study can determine the viable mycobiome. Fungi are extremophiles that can survive harsh conditions such as low nutrient [ 33 ], desiccation [ 34 ], high/low temperatures [ 35 , 36 ], acidic/alkaline [ 37 , 38 ], radiation [ 39 , 40 ], and other environments [ 41 , 42 ]. Fungal species not only have been isolated from all known environments on Earth, including barren lands like deserts, caves, or nuclear accident sites, but also are known to be difficult to eradicate from other types of environments including indoor and closed spaces [ 8 , 36 , 42 , 43 ]. Characterizing and understanding possible changes to, and succession of, fungal species in the ILMAH is of high importance since some of the fungi are extremophiles that are not only potentially hazardous to inhabitants but also can deteriorate the habitat itself [ 25 , 44 , 45 ]. It was previously reported that people spending a significant amount of time indoors might suffer from so called “sick building syndrome” (SBS). SBS is characterized by health- and comfort-related syndromes (e.g., headache, tiredness) that ease after leaving a building. Fatigue and discomfort might be caused not only by physical characteristics of the closed system (humidity, temperature, lighting) but also by biological contamination from both bacteria and fungi [ 46 , 47 ]. Fungal pathogens’ presence in indoor areas might pose health hazards for people exhibiting immunodeficiency [ 48 ]. Pathogenic fungi produce a range of secondary metabolites (SMs) that influence their virulence (e.g., melanins, siderophores, or species-specific toxins), induce allergies, and cause diseases (e.g., aspergillosis, candidiasis, or cryptococcosis) [ 48 , 49 ]. Prolonged stays in closed habitats (e.g., ILMAH, ISS, etc.) might be stressful for inhabitants and lead to a decrease in immune response; therefore, assessing the presence of any opportunistic pathogens is vital [ 50 ]. Previous reports on the mycobiome in NASA clean rooms and on the ISS documented NGS results from samples collected from various locations, but none of the studies focused on the analysis of the microbial succession of systematically collected samples [ 28 , 32 ]. The bacterial and archaeal microbiome succession of the ILMAH using NGS has been carried out [ 7 ]. This is the first report characterizing the succession of fungi in a simulated closed system meant for human habitation on other planets utilizing both traditional and state-of-the-art molecular techniques. In addition, attempts were made during this study to elucidate the temporal and spatial distribution of the fungal population and diversity in a closed human habitat.",Methods,Results,Discussion,,Conclusions,Human presence impacts fungal diversity of inflated lunar/Mars analog habitat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5504618/,

The Microbial Tracking 1 (MT-1) project was the first ISS environmental surface study to report on the metagenome profiles without using whole-genome amplification. The study surveyed the microbial communities from eight surfaces over a 14-month period. The Microbial Tracking 2 (MT-2) project aimed to continue the work of MT-1, sampling an additional four flights from the same locations, over another 14 months. Methods Eight surfaces across the ISS were sampled with sterile wipes and processed upon return to Earth. DNA extracted from the processed samples (and controls) were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA) to detect intact/viable cells or left untreated and to detect the total DNA population (free DNA/compromised cells/intact cells/viable cells). DNA extracted from PMA-treated and untreated samples were analyzed using shotgun metagenomics. Samples were cultured for bacteria and fungi to supplement the above results. Results Staphylococcus sp. and Malassezia sp. were the most represented bacterial and fungal species, respectively, on the ISS. Overall, the ISS surface microbiome was dominated by organisms associated with the human skin. Multi-dimensional scaling and differential abundance analysis showed significant temporal changes in the microbial population but no spatial differences. The ISS antimicrobial resistance gene profiles were however more stable over time, with no differences over the 5-year span of the MT-1 and MT-2 studies. Twenty-nine antimicrobial resistance genes were detected across all samples, with macrolide/lincosamide/streptogramin resistance being the most widespread. Metagenomic assembled genomes were reconstructed from the dataset, resulting in 82 MAGs. Functional assessment of the collective MAGs showed a propensity for amino acid utilization over carbohydrate metabolism. Co-occurrence analyses showed strong associations between bacterial and fungal genera. Culture analysis showed the microbial load to be on average 3.0 × 10 5 cfu/m 2 Conclusions Utilizing various metagenomics analyses and culture methods, we provided a comprehensive analysis of the ISS surface microbiome, showing microbial burden, bacterial and fungal species prevalence, changes in the microbiome, and resistome over time and space, as well as the functional capabilities and microbial interactions of this unique built microbiome.

In addition to traditional microbial taxonomic approaches, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis was performed to classify the phylogenetic lineage. Agar diffusion discs assay was performed to test antibiotics susceptibility. The draft genomes after assembly and scaffolding were annotated with the Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology and RNAmmer servers for downstream analysis. Results Molecular phylogeny and whole genome analysis of the ISS strains with all publicly available Enterobacter genomes revealed that ISS strains were E. bugandensis and similar to the type strain EB-247 T and two clinical isolates (153_ECLO and MBRL 1077). Comparative genomic analyses of all eight E. bungandensis strains showed, a total of 4733 genes were associated with carbohydrate metabolism (635 genes), amino acid and derivatives (496 genes), protein metabolism (291 genes), cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments (275 genes), membrane transport (247 genes), and RNA metabolism (239 genes). In addition, 112 genes identified in the ISS strains were involved in virulence, disease, and defense. Genes associated with resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, including the MDR tripartite system were also identified in the ISS strains. A multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) locus or MAR operon encoding MarA, MarB, MarC, and MarR, which regulate more than 60 genes, including upregulation of drug efflux systems that have been reported in Escherichia coli K12, was also observed in the ISS strains. Conclusion Given the MDR results for these ISS Enterobacter genomes and increased chance of pathogenicity (PathogenFinder algorithm with > 79% probability), these species pose important health considerations for future missions. Thorough genomic characterization of the strains isolated from ISS can help to understand the pathogenic potential, and inform future missions, but analyzing them in in-vivo systems is required to discern the influence of microgravity on their pathogenicity.

The characterization and analysis of these two genomes may have important implications for the medical, agricultural, and food industries as well as for the health of the crew who coinhabit the ISS with these strains.",INTRODUCTION,MATERIALS AND METHODS,RESULTS,DISCUSSION,"MATERIALS AND METHODS Isolation of fungal strains. Surfaces (1 m 2 ) were sampled on the ISS using premoistened 9-in. by 9-in. polyester wipes (ITW Texwipe, Mahwah, NJ) that were prepared as part of an ongoing microbial tracking study during flight sampling 3 (6 May 2016). Wipes were stored at room temperature (RT) before being brought back to Earth, 6 days after sampling, where they were processed as described previously ( 63 ). Material from the wipes was plated, 100 μl, on potato dextrose agar (PDA) supplemented with chloramphenicol (final concentration, 100 μg/ml) and incubated at 25°C for 7 days. Fusarium oxysporum , identified by morphology and ITS region sequencing, was isolated from the ISS dining table. The two isolates were designated ISS-F3 and ISS-F4. Whole-genome sequencing. (i) Genomic DNA extraction. Freezer stocks of ISS-F3/F4 were plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates and incubated at 25°C for 5 days, at which time the entire plate was covered with fungal growth. The growth over the entire plate was scraped into a sterile mortar and pestle containing a small amount of liquid nitrogen. The colonies were ground into a powder and then transferred into PowerBead tubes from the MoBio PowerSoil DNA isolation kit (Qiagen, USA; catalog number 12888), and the extraction protocol was followed per the manufacturer’s instructions, except for the last step, in which DNA was eluted in 80 μl of solution C6 (i.e., elution buffer). DNA was stored at −20°C until sent for sequencing. (ii) Sequencing and assembly. Genomic DNA was paired-end sequenced (2 × 100 bp) with a 350-bp insert size on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform by Macrogen (Rockville, MD, USA). Totals of 48 million reads for F3 and 42 million reads for F4 were generated. Trimmomatic on the Galaxy server ( https://usegalaxy.org ) was used to remove the sequencing adaptors (settings: maximum mismatch, 2; accuracy of the match between the two adaptor-ligated reads, 30; accuracy of the match between any adaptor, 10) and to trim the leading and trailing ends (settings: minimum quality required to keep a base, 3). Postprocessed reads were de novo assembled using ABySS version 2.0.2 ( 19 ) using the default settings. Different k-mer sizes ranging from 68 to 90 were tested in order to find the one that gave the highest N 50 score and lowest number of scaffolds/contigs, after assembly. The k-mer size 86 gave the best results for both F3 and F4, and the resulting assemblies were used for downstream analyses. Phylogenetic analysis. The phylogeny of the newly identified strains was assessed by extracting the full-length gene sequence of translation elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1α) from each of the genomes using BLASTN. The sequences were aligned using MUSCLE with default parameters ( 64 ), and phylogeny was inferred with PhyML ( 65 ) (1,000 bootstraps; percent bootstrap confidence is shown in red numbers in the tree). The trees were visualized using ETE 3 ( 66 ). The effector clustering was done on only the F. oxysporum strains, using the list of 104 curated F. oxysporum effector candidate genes and the same clustering method as described in the work of van Dam et al. ( 24 ). Briefly, 2.5-kb regions up- and downstream of a miniature impala ( mimp ) transposable element were scanned for potential open reading frames (ORFs) containing a signal peptide. This procedure was previously done by van Dam et al. ( 24 ) for 59 individual isolates of F. oxysporum , and the resulting effector candidate genes were grouped and merged into a list. Obvious false positives and transposable elements were removed, and multiple instances of the same effector were reduced to one representative. This curated list represents the “effectorome” of a varied set of plant-pathogenic formae speciales of F. oxysporum . Screening for the presence of the putative 104 effectors was done using BLASTN (as described above). A binary data matrix was generated containing presence (“1”) or absence (“0”’) of each candidate in each genome. This table was used as input for hierarchical clustering performed in R, using a Jaccard binary distance matrix and average linkage. The resulting matrix was visualized using the “heatmap3” package in R. The sequences of the 10 phylogenetically informative loci used to compare ISS-F3/F4 were extracted from the genomes using the sequences of these genes in the reference genome of F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici 4287. The sequences were kindly provided by Li-Jun Ma from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. The loci and chromosomal locations from the reference genome are as follows: chromosome 1, DNA-directed RNA polymerase III subunit RPC2 and RPB1; chromosome 4, minichromosome maintenance protein 3 and anaphase-promoting complex subunit 1; chromosome 5, two hypothetical proteins, FOXG 1751.3 and 2073.3; chromosome 7, DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit RPB2; chromosome 8, hypothetical protein FOXG 3560.3; and chromosome 9, clathrin heavy chain and DNA polymerase gamma ( 28 ). k-mer analysis for strain identification. The KMC2 k-mer counter ( 29 ) tool was used to generate 50-bp-long k-mers from 65 F. oxysporum genomes that were downloaded from GenBank ( ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/genbank/fungi/Fusarium_oxysporum/ ) (see Table S1 in Data Set S5 in the supplemental material). The KMC2 program was also used to determine which of the k-mers generated from each genome were unique to that genome. A subset of the unique k-mers were chosen, based on number of occurrences (chosen if they appeared once, instead of multiple times within the genome) and the type of sequence (the sequence did not contain a lot of repeats and had a good balance of GC and AT ratios). Using command line BLAST (version ncbi-blast-2.4.0+), the genomes of F3 and F4 were used as the query against the “database” of unique k-mer sequences. For ISS- F3 or ISS-F4 to be considered one of the 65 F. oxysporum strains, every k-mer in the database belonging to a specific strain had to have a perfect match against a sequence in either the F3 or F4 genome. Single nucleotide polymorphism detection and phylogenetic analysis. We applied a reference-based analysis method to determine the relatedness of F3 and F4 to the reference genome, Fo47, and to 5 other F. oxysporum isolates. The list of these strains and the reasons for including them in the analysis are presented in Table S3 in Data Set S5 . These publicly available genomes were downloaded from the NCBI sequence read archive (SRA). SNP identification was carried out using PhaME (version 1.0.2) ( 67 ), which uses Nucmer for pairwise alignment of genomes. Evolutionary analyses and phylogenetic trees were constructed as part of the PhaME pipeline. The numbers of SNPs spanning the entire genome, in coding regions, and in noncoding regions were extracted from the PhaME output using a custom Perl script and plotted in Prism (version 7). In order to detect SNPs in the coding regions, a gff annotation file of the reference genome (Fo47) was supplied as input. Gene prediction and annotation. The genes of the assembled ISS-F3/F4 genomes were predicted with the AUGUSTUS gene prediction program using default settings and trained against Fusarium graminearum ( 30 , 68 ). The amino acid sequences of the predicted genes were uploaded into Blast2GO ( https://www.blast2go.com ) ( 69 ), and annotation was performed with blastp-fast against the NCBI nonredundant database, set to the “fungi” taxonomy filter. The E value cutoff was set to <1.0E−10. Gene ontology classification and InterProScan were also performed with Blast2GO using the default settings. Identification of polyketides and secondary metabolites. Predicted proteins that were annotated as polyketide synthases were further evaluated with the polyketide synthase database ( 35 ), which consists of amino acid sequences of PKSs from 12 F. oxysporum strains and 8 other Fusarium species. A blastp search was performed with F3 and F4 sequences, and a positive match was based on >95% identity and an E value of <1E−10. Biosynthetic gene clusters were predicted with the fungal version of antiSMASH ( https://fungismash.secondarymetabolites.org ). The input files were the (i) assembled whole-genome nucleotide sequences and (ii) gff annotation file produced from AUGUSTUS. Default settings were used in the run. C. elegans model for Fusarium oxysporum virulence. The glp-4/sek-1 mutant strain AU37 of C. elegans obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center ( http://www.cbs.umn.edu/research/resources/cgc ) was used in the experiments. C. elegans AU37 nematodes were synchronized for the experiment as previously described ( 70 ). Synchronized nematodes were then grown on E. coli OP50 lawns until they reached the L3-L4 stage. Then nematodes (about 300 worms) were collected and washed 3 times in 10 ml of M9 buffer ( 71 ) containing 50 µg/ml kanamycin. On the last washing, worms were incubated in 10 ml M9 buffer containing 50 µg/ml kanamycin for 1 h to clean the intestinal tube and surface of nematodes from E. coli . After cleaning, nematodes were poured on plain agar plates (1.5% agar in water) to soak the kanamycin solution into agar. At this point, synchronized fasting nematodes were ready for transferring into experimental fungal conidium suspensions. Fungal conidium suspensions were prepared by growing the fungal strains on PDA plates and incubating them at 25°C for 7 days, at which time the plate was overgrown with growth. Eight milliliters of ST solution (8.5 g NaCl, 1 ml Tween 80 in 1 liter of water) was poured onto the plates, and a cotton swab was used to scrape all the moistened fungi off the plate. The liquid suspension on the plate was then transferred to a 50-ml Falcon tube, spun down at 3,500 × g for 5 min, and washed 3 times with sterile PBS. The pellet was then resuspended in 5 ml of sterile PBS. To count the number of conidia in the suspension, a 1/10 dilution was prepared using ST solution and conidia were counted using a hemocytometer under the 40× objective of a light microscope. Conidial stocks were diluted in PBS to 10 7 conidia/ml prior to the experiment. Twenty microliters of 10 7 -conidia/ml F. oxysporum spores were suspended in 1 ml of 30% (vol/vol) brain heart infusion broth (BHI broth; Remel, USA) prepared by dilution of BHI broth in M9 buffer. For each conidium suspension, 60 worms were transferred from plain agar plates into 1 ml of a conidium suspension and incubated for 1 h at 25°C without agitation. After incubation, the entire reaction volume of conidium suspension with worms was transferred to a 60-mm dish containing 2 ml of M9 buffer with 50 µg/ml kanamycin. Then, worms were collected by a micropipette and transferred to a 60-mm dish containing 3 ml of M9 buffer with 50 µg/ml kanamycin. This procedure was repeated 3 times using 3 ml of fresh M9 buffer with 50 µg/ml kanamycin in a 60-mm dish at each transfer. After final washing, 10 worms were transferred into each experimental 30-mm dish (3 dishes per one fungal strain conidium suspension) containing 2 ml of 30% BHI broth and 50 µg/ml kanamycin. Worms were incubated at 25°C without agitation, and worm death was estimated at 17, 24, 44, and 50 h after conidium exposure using an Olympus SZX16 microscope (×5 magnification) with a camera (Olympus DP30BW) for imaging.

To date, mandatory microbial monitoring and observational studies of spacecraft and space stations have been conducted by traditional culture methods, although it is known that many microbes cannot be cultured with standard techniques. To fully appreciate the true number and diversity of microbes that survive in the ISS, molecular and culture-based methods were used to assess microbial communities on ISS surfaces. Samples were taken at eight pre-defined locations during three flight missions spanning 14 months and analyzed upon return to Earth. Results The cultivable bacterial and fungal population ranged from 10 4 to 10 9 CFU/m 2 depending on location and consisted of various bacterial ( Actinobacteria , Firmicutes , and Proteobacteria ) and fungal ( Ascomycota and Basidiomycota ) phyla. Amplicon sequencing detected more bacterial phyla when compared to the culture-based analyses, but both methods identified similar numbers of fungal phyla. Changes in bacterial and fungal load (by culture and qPCR) were observed over time but not across locations. Bacterial community composition changed over time, but not across locations, while fungal community remained the same between samplings and locations. There were no significant differences in community composition and richness after propidium monoazide sample treatment, suggesting that the analyzed DNA was extracted from intact/viable organisms. Moreover, approximately 46% of intact/viable bacteria and 40% of intact/viable fungi could be cultured. Conclusions The results reveal a diverse population of bacteria and fungi on ISS environmental surfaces that changed over time but remained similar between locations. The dominant organisms are associated with the human microbiome and may include opportunistic pathogens. This study provides the first comprehensive catalog of both total and intact/viable bacteria and fungi found on surfaces in closed space systems and can be used to help develop safety measures that meet NASA requirements for deep space human habitation.

The current study is the first report comparing the commercial resupply vehicle (CRV) microbiome with the International Space Station (ISS) microbiome to understand the risks of contamination, thus serving as a model system for future planetary missions. Results Samples obtained from the internal surfaces and ground support equipment of three CRV missions were subjected to various molecular techniques for microbial diversity analysis. In total, 25 samples were collected with eight defined locations from each CRV mission prior to launch. In general, the internal surfaces of vehicles were clean, with an order of magnitude fewer microbes compared to ground support equipment. The first CRV mission had a larger microbial population than subsequent CRV missions, which were clean as compared to the initial CRV locations sampled. Cultivation assays showed the presence of Actinobacteria , Proteobacteria , Firmicutes , and Bacteroidetes and members of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota . As expected, shotgun metagenome analyses revealed the presence of more microbial taxa compared to cultivation-based assays. The internal locations of the CRV microbiome reportedly showed the presence of microorganisms capable of tolerating ultraviolet radiation (e.g., Bacillus firmus ) and clustered separately from the ISS microbiome. Conclusions The metagenome sequence comparison of the CRV microbiome with the ISS microbiome revealed significant differences showing that CRV microbiomes were a negligible part of the ISS environmental microbiome.

The sequence similarity of these three ISS strains, designated as IF7SW-B2 T , IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, was <99.4% for 16S rRNA genes and <97.3% for gyrB gene, with the closest being Methylobacterium indicum SE2.11 T . Furthermore, the multi-locus sequence analysis placed these three ISS strains in the same clade of M. indicum. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) values of these three ISS strains were <93% and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) values were <46.4% with any described Methylobacterium species. Based on the ANI and dDDH analyses, these three ISS strains were considered as novel species belonging to the genus Methylobacterium. The three ISS strains showed 100% ANI similarity and dDDH values with each other, indicating that these three ISS strains, isolated during various flights and from different locations, belong to the same species. These three ISS strains were found to grow optimally at temperatures from 25 to 30°C, pH 6.0 to 8.0, and NaCl 0 to 1%. Phenotypically, these three ISS strains resemble M. aquaticum and M. terrae since they assimilate similar sugars as sole carbon substrate when compared to other Methylobacterium species. Fatty acid analysis showed that the major fatty acid produced by the ISS strains are C 18 : 1 −ω7 c and C 18 : 1 −ω6 c . The predominant quinone was ubiquinone 10, and the major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and an unidentified lipid. Therefore, based on genomic, phylogenetic, biochemical, and fatty acid analyses, strains IF7SW-B2 T , IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, are assigned to a novel species within the genus Methylobacterium , and the name Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov. is proposed.

Understanding how diversity is maintained and distributed across time and space can provide insights into the potential for evolution and extinction of populations. Immunogenetic diversity aids individuals and populations in resisting infectious disease, with many studies linking resistance to genes encoding adaptive immune responses, such as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. The MHC is particularly important for advancing our understanding of local adaptive processes and host–parasite interactions. Here, we review the emerging work and theory exploring the geographic and temporal patterns of MHC diversity in the wild and how they are shaped by selective and demographic processes. We discuss patterns of variation along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients and place this in the context of Latitude Diversity Gradient and Central Marginal Theories. We emphasize how MHC diversity is often lower at the edges of species distributions, particularly in high‐latitude and high‐altitude regions. We also discuss MHC diversity in natural populations facing climate change. As climate change accelerates and emerging parasites spread, reduced immunogenetic diversity could severely threaten wildlife populations, compromising their resilience and long‐term survival. We propose that including immunogenetic diversity into a larger database of environmental and parasite data would allow biologists to test hypotheses regarding host–parasite coevolution and develop effective measures for conservation.",Introduction,,,,,Conclusions,Advances in Space Microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12034939/,

Due to a broad ecological plasticity and adaptations at the cellular level, it is predicted that they may survive in a variety of extreme environments, including harsh niches on Earth and Mars, and in outer space. However, the molecular mechanisms aiding survival, especially in space, are yet to be fully elucidated. Based on these premises, the rock-inhabiting black fungus Knufia chersonesos (Wt) and its non-melanized mutant (Mut) were exposed to simulated microgravity—one of the prevalent features characterizing space conditions—by growing the cultures in high-aspect-ratio vessels (HARVs). Qualitative and quantitative proteomic analyses were performed on the mycelia and supernatant of culture medium (secretome) to assess alterations in cell physiology in response to low-shear simulated microgravity (LSSMG) and to ultimately evaluate the role of cell-wall melanization in stress survival. Differential expression was observed for proteins involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolic processes, transport, and ribosome biogenesis and translation via ribosomal translational machinery. However, no evidence of significant activation of stress components or starvation response was detected, except for the scytalone dehydratase, enzyme involved in the synthesis of dihydroxynaphthalene (DNH) melanin, which was found to be upregulated in the secretome of the wild type and downregulated in the mutant. Differences in protein modulation were observed between K. chersonesos Wt and Mut, with several proteins being downregulated under LSSMG in the Mut when compared to the Wt. Lastly, no major morphological alterations were observed following exposure to LSSMG. Similarly, the strains’ survivability was not negatively affected. This study is the first to characterize the response to simulated microgravity in black fungi, which might have implications on future astrobiological missions.",Introduction,Materials and Methods,Results,Discussion,,,Effects of simulated microgravity on the proteome and secretome of the polyextremotolerant black fungus Knufia chersonesos.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8012687/,

Certain similarities have been observed in some physiological processes of rodents and astronauts in space, although there are also differences. These similarities make rodents helpful models for initial investigations into space-induced physiological changes. This study uses a 3D-Clinostat to simulate microgravity and explores the role of microgravity in space flight-induced liver and brain abnormalities by comparing changes in the gut microbiota, serum metabolites, and the function and physiological biochemistry of liver and brain tissues between the simulated microgravity (SMG) group mice and the wild type (WT) group mice. The study, based on hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, 16S sequencing technology, and non-targeted metabolomics analysis, shows that the gut tissue morphology of the SMG group mice is abnormal, and the structure of the gut microbiota and the serum metabolite profile are imbalanced. Furthermore, using PICRUST 2 technology, we have predicted the functions of the gut microbiota and serum metabolites, and the results indicate that the liver metabolism and functions (including lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and sugar metabolism, etc.) of the SMG group mice are disrupted, and the brain tissue metabolism and functions (including neurotransmitters and hormone secretion, etc.) are abnormal, suggesting a close relationship between microgravity and liver metabolic dysfunction and brain dysfunction. Additionally, the high similarity in the structure of the gut microbiota and serum metabolite profile between the fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) group mice and the SMG group mice, and the physiological and biochemical differences in liver and brain tissues compared to the WT group mice, suggest that microgravity induces imbalances in the gut microbiota, which in turn triggers abnormalities in liver and brain metabolism and function. Finally, through MetaMapp analysis and Pearson correlation analysis, we found that valeric acid, a metabolite of gut microbiota, is more likely to be the key metabolite that relates to microgravity-induced gut microbiota abnormalities, disorders of amino acid and lipid metabolism, and further induced metabolic or functional disorders in the liver and brain. This study has significant practical application value for deepening the understanding of the adaptability of living organisms in the space environment.",1. Introduction,4. Materials and Methods,2.

PMC8754149,10.1128/spectrum.01994-21,Genomic Characterization of Potential Plant Growth-Promoting Features of Sphingomonas Strains Isolated from the International Space Station,Microbiology Spectrum,2022,"Lombardino, J; Bijlani, S; Singh, N; Wood, J; Barker, R; Gilroy, S; Wang, C; Venkateswaran, K","ABSTRACT In an ongoing microbial tracking investigation of the International Space Station (ISS), several Sphingomonas strains were isolated. Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence, phylogenetic analysis identified the ISS strains as Sphingomonas sanguinis ( n = 2) and one strain isolated from the Kennedy Space Center cleanroom (used to assemble various Mars mission spacecraft components) as Sphingomonas paucimobilis . Metagenomic sequence analyses of different ISS locations identified 23 Sphingomonas species. An abundance of shotgun metagenomic reads were detected for S. sanguinis in the location from where the ISS strains were isolated. A complete metagenome-assembled genome was generated from the shotgun reads metagenome, and its comparison with the whole-genome sequences (WGS) of the ISS S. sanguinis isolates revealed that they were highly similar. In addition to the phylogeny, the WGS of these Sphingomonas strains were compared with the WGS of the type strains to elucidate genes that can potentially aid in plant growth promotion. Furthermore, the WGS comparison of these strains with the well-characterized Sphingomonas sp. LK11, an arid desert strain, identified several genes responsible for the production of phytohormones and for stress tolerance. Production of one of the phytohormones, indole-3-acetic acid, was further confirmed in the ISS strains using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Pathways associated with phosphate uptake, metabolism, and solubilization in soil were conserved across all the S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis strains tested. Furthermore, genes thought to promote plant resistance to abiotic stress, including heat/cold shock response, heavy metal resistance, and oxidative and osmotic stress resistance, appear to be present in these space-related S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis strains. Characterizing these biotechnologically important microorganisms found on the ISS and harnessing their key features will aid in the development of self-sustainable long-term space missions in the future. IMPORTANCE Sphingomonas is ubiquitous in nature, including the anthropogenically contaminated extreme environments. Members of the Sphingomonas genus have been identified as potential candidates for space biomining beyond earth. This study describes the isolation and identification of Sphingomonas members from the ISS, which are capable of producing the phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid. Microbial production of phytohormones will help future in situ studies, grow plants beyond low earth orbit, and establish self-sustainable life support systems. Beyond phytohormone production, stable genomic elements of abiotic stress resistance, heavy metal resistance, and oxidative and osmotic stress resistance were identified, rendering the ISS Sphingomonas isolate a strong candidate for biotechnology-related applications.",INTRODUCTION,MATERIALS AND METHODS,RESULTS,DISCUSSION,"MATERIALS AND METHODS Sample collection and whole-genome sequence analysis. Sample collection and processing, followed by WGS and assembly that led to the isolation of Sphingomonas strains, are described elsewhere ( 25 , 63 ). Samples collected across different locations on the ISS, and the KSC-PHSF cleanroom, were plated on Reasoner’s 2A agar (R2A) to culture different bacterial colonies ( 25 ). In addition to cultivation, previously published metagenomic sequences sampled from ISS locations were downloaded from NCBI ( 26 ) and analyzed for the presence of Sphingomonas species, and MAGs were generated. DNA extraction was followed by metagenomic sequencing and assembly as described previously ( 26 ). Identification of Sphingomonas spp. from metagenomic assembly was performed as described elsewhere ( 59 ). In the case of S. sanguinis genome assembled from the metagenome, sample collection, processing, and DNA extraction were carried out as reported previously ( 26 ). The assembled draft genomes were annotated using NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) 4.11 ( 64 , 65 ). The identity of the strains was confirmed based on ANI calculated using EZBioCloud ( 66 ). Genome annotation. To further explore potential functional differences between spaceflight isolates and their respective type strains, we obtained coding sequences from the NCBI RefSeq database and, where applicable, performed additional annotation through the online eggNOG-mapperV2 web server using the default settings ( 67 , 68 ). The coding sequences of the metagenome-assembled genome of S. sanguinis ISS-IIF7SWP were retrieved from the NCBI GenBank database. Coding nucleotide sequences for each Sphingomonas genome along with their respective type strains were annotated using the online eggNOG-MapperV2 software, whose column-based outputs were parsed and compared on a per-genome basis using a custom python script (available for use via https://github.com/jlombo96/Sphingomonas-EggNOG-Workbook ). Preliminary annotations of these select spaceflight isolates highlighted potential connections to the plant endophyte Sphingomonas sp. LK11, a strain well characterized with respect to its plant growth-promoting capabilities ( 12 , 15 , 24 , 27 , 69 ). Given the presence of a thoroughly annotated and complete genome sequence ( 15 ), robust evidence for the production of the plant phytohormones gibberellic acid (GA) and IAA ( 12 , 15 ), and previous use as a model for novel plant-associated Sphingomonas genomes ( 5 ), Sphingomonas sp. LK11 was selected as a reference genome to identify putative plant growth-promoting features in other Sphingomonas genomes. In this study, the endophyte Sphingomonas sp. LK11, two S. sanguinis isolates (IIF7SW-B3A and IIF7SW-B5), and one S. sanguinis MAG (ISS-IIF7SWP) sampled from the ISS, S. paucimobilis FKI-L5-BR-P1 cultured from KSC-PHSF, and S. paucimobilis LCT-SP1 isolated from the Chinese spacecraft Shenzhou X were compared against their respective type strains: S. sanguinis NBRC 13937 T and S. paucimobilis NCTC 11030 T . Metabolite extraction and analysis. Previous reports have characterized the phytohormone production capability of several Sphingomonas species, including Sphingomonas sp. LK11 ( 11 ), S. panacis DCY99 T ( 5 ), and S. paucimobilis ZJSH1 ( 14 ). While both S. paucimobilis ZJSH1 and Sphingomonas sp. LK11 were confirmed to produce the plant phytohormone IAA, the definitive chemical pathway responsible for their production is yet to be elucidated ( 12 , 14 , 15 ). Therefore, the potential for the production of the auxin-derivative IAA in each of the selected S. paucimobilis and S. sanguinis strains was examined. The space isolates ( S. sanguinis IIF7SW-B3A, S. sanguinis IIF7SW-B5, and S. paucimobilis FKI-L5-BR-P1) were streaked on R2A (Difco, USA) and incubated at 28°C for 5 days. The strains were then inoculated in nutrient broth (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) containing 3 g/L l -tryptophan (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and incubated at 28°C, 180 rpm for 7 days. To examine the phytohormones produced and secreted in culture filtrate, we pelleted the cells and extracted the metabolites from the supernatant using ethyl acetate. This step was repeated twice. The culture supernatant was then acidified using 6N HCl and metabolites were extracted using ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate layer after each step described above was transferred to a fresh tube and evaporated in TurboVap LV. The residue obtained after drying the solvent was resuspended in 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/95% (vol/vol) methanol at a final concentration of 1 mg/mL. A suitable aliquot of the extract (10 μL) was injected for HPLC-DAD-MS analysis. Stock solution of IAA standard (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was prepared in 5% DMSO/95% methanol (vol/vol) at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. It was diluted 10 times, and 10 μL of the dilution was injected for HPLC-DAD-MS analysis. HPLC-DAD-MS was carried out using Thermo Finnigan LCQ Advantage ion trap mass spectrometer with an RP C 18 column (Alltech Prevail C 18 3 mm 2.1 by 100 mm) at a flow rate of 125 μL/min. The solvent gradient for liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) was 95% (vol/vol) acetonitrile (MeCN)/H 2 O (solvent B) in 5% MeCN/H 2 O (vol/vol; solvent A), both containing 0.05% (vol/vol) formic acid, as follows: 0% solvent B from 0 to 5 min, 0% to 100% solvent B from 5 min to 30 min, 100% solvent B from 30 to 45 min, 100% to 0% solvent B from 45 to 45.10 min, and reequilibration with 0% solvent B from 45.10 to 50 min. Comparative functional analysis. Genome similarities between spaceflight Sphingomonas strains, their respective type strains, and the plant endophyte Sphingomonas sp. LK11 were visualized using BRIG version 0.95 with the Sphingomonas sp. LK11 (chromosome and plasmids) assigned as the reference genome ( 70 ). Percent identity values for space isolates and corresponding type strains were calculated using blastn (E value: 10, lower identity cutoff: 70%, upper identity cutoff: 90%). To address potential functional differences between space isolates and their corresponding type strains, custom Python and R scripts ( https://github.com/jlombo96/Sphingomonas-EggNOG-Workbook ) were designed to parse output annotation tables and summarize their features on a per-genome basis. Descriptions for select KEGG IDs identified in eggNOG-MapperV2 were assigned using the BioServices API ( 71 ). To identify protein-level differences between the Sphingomonas strains obtained from spaceflight-relevant surfaces and their respective type strains, custom python scripts were created to construct pileup gene count tables for the annotations generated from the EggNOG-MapperV2 software. Genes identified by eggNOG-MapperV2 for the S. paucimobilis and S. sanguinis spaceflight isolates were pooled on a species basis and then compared to their type strains using JVENN ( 72 ) and UpSetR ( 73 ) using intersection analyses. Output tables generated by these analyses are displayed in Table S1. Pangenome analysis. Pangenome analysis of the Sphingomonas space isolates, their type strains, and the plant endophyte Sphingomonas sp. LK11 was performed using Anvi’o v6.2 ( 74 – 76 ). Primary functional annotation in the Anvi’o software was conducted using the anvi-script-FASTA-to-contigs-db and anvi-run-ncbi-cogs commands. Subsequent pangenome gene clustering was carried out using blastp via the anvi-pan-genome command ( – num-threads 2, – mcl-inflation 6, – min-bit 0.5, – use-ncbi-blast). The ordering of the pangenome display was determined using Euclidean distances and ward linkage settings. Ethics approval and consent to participate.

However, the interactions between the various microbes aboard the ISS and how they shape the microbiome remain to be clearly understood. In this study, we apply a computational approach to predict possible metabolic interactions in the ISS microbiome and shed further light on its organization. Results Through a combination of a systems-based graph-theoretical approach, and a constraint-based community metabolic modeling approach, we demonstrated several key interactions in the ISS microbiome. These complementary approaches provided insights into the metabolic interactions and dependencies present amongst various microbes in a community, highlighting key interactions and keystone species. Our results showed that the presence of K. pneumoniae is beneficial to many other microorganisms it coexists with, notably those from the Pantoea genus. Species belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family were often found to be the most beneficial for the survival of other microorganisms in the ISS microbiome. However, K. pneumoniae was found to exhibit parasitic and amensalistic interactions with Aspergillus and Penicillium species, respectively. To prove this metabolic prediction, K. pneumoniae and Aspergillus fumigatus were co-cultured under normal and simulated microgravity, where K. pneumoniae cells showed parasitic characteristics to the fungus. The electron micrography revealed that the presence of K. pneumoniae compromised the morphology of fungal conidia and degenerated its biofilm-forming structures. Conclusion Our study underscores the importance of K. pneumoniae in the ISS, and its potential positive and negative interactions with other microbes, including potential pathogens. This integrated modeling approach, combined with experiments, demonstrates the potential for understanding the organization of other such microbiomes, unravelling key organisms and their interdependencies.

Film media also have the advantage of allowing sample volumes similar to those used in pour plates and, therefore, are well-suited for cultivable microbial counts in extremely low-biomass environments such as clean rooms or space habitats, particularly where the subsequent isolation of colonies is necessary. As the preparation of film media plates relies on water cohesion/adhesion rather than manual spreading, they may have future applications in low- or microgravity settings. In this study, cultivable microbial count performance was compared between agar media and film media in three kinds of samples: food items, surfaces in built environments on Earth (homes), and on the environmental surfaces of the International Space Station (ISS). Easy Plates (Kikkoman Corporation) and Petrifilm (3M) were compared with traditional agar plating for food and home surfaces, while only Easy Plates were compared with agar for ISS samples. For both food items and built environments on Earth, both types of film media performed comparably to agar media for bacterial counts, with R 2 values of 0.94–0.96. Fungal counts for built-environment samples had a lower correlation between film and agar counts, with R 2 values of 0.72–0.73. Samples from the ISS, which ranged from below detection to 10 3 CFU per 100 cm 2 , had R 2 values of 0.80 for bacterial counts and 0.73 for fungal counts, partially due to multiple samples recording below the detection limit for agar or too numerous to count, and the growth of fungal species on R2A medium. The species compositions of isolates picked from agar vs. film media plates were similar; however, further phylogenetic analysis is needed to confirm the differential microbial diversity composition. Overall, film media such as Easy Plates and Petrifilm are viable alternatives to agar plates for low-biomass built environments as well as for food samples, and the two brands tested in this study performed equally well.",1.

Acinetobacter pittii is an opportunistic nosocomial pathogen, primarily impacting immunocompromised patients, that was recently isolated from two missions aboard the ISS. Results Here, we report how ISS-associated A. pittii ( n = 20 genomes) has formed its own genetically and functionally discrete clade distinct from most Earth-bound isolates ( n = 291 genomes). The antimicrobial susceptibility testing of ISS strains and two related clinical isolates demonstrated that ISS strains acquired more resistance, specifically with regard to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, despite no prediction of increased resistance based on genomic analysis of resistance genes. By investigating 402 longitudinal environmental and host-associated ISS metagenomes, we observed that viable A. pittii is increasing in relative abundance and therefore potentially exhibiting succession, being identified in >2X more metagenomic samples in back-to-back missions. ISS strains additionally contain functions that enable them to survive in harsh environments, including the transcriptional regulator LexA. Via a genome-wide association study, we identified a high level of mutational burden in methionine sulfoxide reductase genes relative to the most closely related Earth strains.

However, metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of ISS samples are yet to be generated and subjected to various genomic analyses, including phylogenetic affiliation, predicted functional pathways, antimicrobial resistance, and virulence characteristics. Results In total, 46 MAGs were assembled from 21 ISS environmental metagenomes, in which metaSPAdes yielded 20 MAGs and metaWRAP generated 26 MAGs. Among 46 MAGs retrieved, 18 bacterial species were identified, including one novel genus/species combination ( Kalamiella piersonii ) and one novel bacterial species ( Methylobacterium ajmalii ). In addition, four bins exhibited fungal genomes; this is the first-time fungal genomes were assembled from ISS metagenomes. Phylogenetic analyses of five bacterial species showed ISS-specific evolution. The genes pertaining to cell membranes, such as transmembrane transport, cell wall organization, and regulation of cell shape, were enriched. Variations in the antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) and virulence genes of the selected 20 MAGs were characterized to predict the ecology and evolution of biosafety level (BSL) 2 microorganisms in space. Since microbial virulence increases in microgravity, AMR gene sequences of MAGs were compared with genomes of respective ISS isolates and corresponding type strains. Among these 20 MAGs characterized, AMR genes were more prevalent in the Enterobacter bugandensis MAG, which has been predominantly isolated from clinical samples. MAGs were further used to analyze if genes involved in AMR and biofilm formation of viable microbes in ISS have variation due to generational evolution in microgravity and radiation pressure. Conclusions Comparative analyses of MAGs and whole-genome sequences of related ISS isolates and their type strains were characterized to understand the variation related to the microbial evolution under microgravity. The Pantoea / Kalamiella strains have the maximum single-nucleotide polymorphisms found within the ISS strains examined. This may suggest that Pantoea / Kalamiella strains are much more subjective to microgravity changes. The reconstructed genomes will enable researchers to study the evolution of genomes under microgravity and low-dose irradiation compared to the evolution of microbes here on Earth.

This strain was identified as a gram-positive, rod-shaped, oxidase-positive, catalase-negative motile bacterium in the genus Cohnella , designated as F6_2S_P_1 T . The 16S sequence of the F6_2S_P_1 T strain places it in a clade with C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli , which were originally isolated from plant tissue or rhizosphere environments. The closest 16S and gyrB matches to strain F6_2S_P_1 T are to C. rhizosphaerae with 98.84 and 93.99% sequence similarity, while a core single-copy gene phylogeny from all publicly available Cohnella genomes places it as more closely related to C. ginsengisoli . Average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) values to any described Cohnella species are <89 and <22%, respectively. The major fatty acids for strain F6_2S_P_1 T are anteiso-C 15:0 (51.7%), iso-C 16:0 (23.1%), and iso-C 15:0 (10.5%), and it is able to metabolize a wide range of carbon compounds. Given the results of the ANI and dDDH analyses, this ISS strain is a novel species within the genus Cohnella for which we propose the name Cohnella hashimotonis , with the type strain F6_2S_P_1 T (=NRRL B-65657 T and DSMZ 115098 T ). Because no closely related Cohnella genomes were available, this study generated the whole-genome sequences (WGSs) of the type strains for C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli . Phylogenetic and pangenomic analysis reveals that F6_2S_P_1 T , C. rhizosphaerae , and C. ginsengisoli , along with two uncharacterized Cohnella strains, possess a shared set of 332 gene clusters which are not shared with any other WGS of Cohnella species, and form a distinct clade branching off from C. nanjingensis .

F6_2S_P_1 T and place it within the established taxonomy of the genus Cohnella . Based on these data, we propose that this novel species be named C. hashimotonis . We also characterized the branch of Cohnella within which C. hashimotonis is placed and predicted functional characteristics of C. hashimotonis and the C. ginsengisoli clade as a whole. All species of Cohnella closely related to C. hashimotonis are from the plant/rhizosphere environment and likely have mutualistic associations with plant roots or other tissue. It is likely, therefore, that C. hashimotonis was introduced to the ISS not as a human commensal but as a plant commensal during one of the many plant growth experiments conducted on board. Nevertheless, C. hashimotonis can clearly survive in the extreme conditions of the ISS built environment, including radiation exposure, desiccation, low nutrient availability, and microgravity, and is closely related to a number of rhizosphere bacteria; it is therefore a promising candidate for testing as a member of plant-growth-promoting consortia for future plant experiments in outer space.","Description of Cohnella hashimotonis sp. nov. Cohnella hashimotonis (ha.shi.mo.to.nis. masc. n. hashimotonis named in honor of Professor Hideo Hashimoto, a food microbiologist from Hiroshima Univ., Japan). Cells are endospore-forming, aerobic, and gram-positive rods, 0.5–0.6 μm in width and 0.8–100+ μm in length. In addition to normal cells, elongated, spaghetti-like cells ( Figures 4D , 5B ) are observed in light microscopy and SEM images. Colonies are translucent cream-colored, acquiring a pinkish tinge after multiple days of growth, and grow well on R2A but poorly on TSA. Growth occurs at between 15 and 37°C, between pHs 6 and 8, and from 0 to 3% NaCl. Colonies are weakly oxidase-positive and catalase-negative. This species reduces nitrate to nitrite, produces dextrin from starch, and utilizes the following carbon substrates: alanine, histidine, serine, sucrose, L-arabinose, melibiose, D-fructose, inositol, and lactose. The following substances are utilized for acid production: maltose, sucrose, D-fructose, D-ribose, N-acetyl, glucosamine, lactose, and trisodium citrate. Major fatty acids composing C. hashimotonis are anteiso-C 15:0 (51.7%), iso-C 16:0 (23.1%), and iso-C 15:0 (10.5%). The polar lipids are diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, three aminophospholipids, and a phospholipid. The major quinone system is menaquinones MK-7. The cell-wall peptidoglycan of strain contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diamino acid. C. hashimotonis is closely related to C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli based on 16 rRNA gene sequence similarity (<99%). However, the phylogenetic position of the strain F6_2S_P_1 T was resolved as a novel species due to gyrB sequence similarity (<94%), ANI (<89%), and dDDH (<35%) analyses with any other sequenced Cohnella species. GC content is 58.37%. The type strain F6_2S_P_1 T was isolated from the wall behind the Waste Hygiene Compartment, i.e., the space toilet, aboard the ISS, in 2018; its genome is available on NCBI, accession number JAGRPV000000000 . The type strain F6_2S_P_1 T is submitted to two culture collections (=NRRL B-65657 T and DSMZ 115098 T ).",Comparative genomic analysis of Cohnella hashimotonis sp. nov. isolated from the International Space Station,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10308117/,
PMC10715203,10.1128/spectrum.01897-23,Genomic analysis reveals the presence of emerging pathogenic Klebsiella lineages aboard the International Space Station,Microbiology Spectrum,2023,"Miliotis, G; McDonagh, F; Singh, N; O'Connor, L; Tuohy, A; Morris, D; Venkateswaran, K","ABSTRACT Klebsiella species, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae , Klebsiella aerogenes , and Klebsiella quasipneumoniae , are opportunistic pathogens that commonly cause infections in humans. Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKP) is a subgroup of K. pneumoniae, which has gained attention due to its global dissemination, its capacity to cause invasive infections in community settings among immunocompetent individuals, and its escalating antibiotic resistance levels. Our study presents the first comprehensive phenotypic and genotypic analysis including mobile genetic elements (MGEs) of Klebsiella isolates from the International Space Station (ISS). The genomes of K. pneumoniae , K. aerogenes , and K. quasipneumoniae offered insights into their antimicrobial resistance, virulence, thermotolerance, disinfectant resistance, and MGEs. All isolates were part of emerging pathogenic lineages with K. quasipneumoniae ST138 presenting spatial and temporal persistence aboard the ISS, possibly due to its genotypic profile encoding for numerous resistance genes to disinfectants and heavy metals. We also report on the isolation of a yersiniabactin-encoding K. pneumoniae, belonging to the emerging high-risk ST101 clone, aboard the ISS. A potential dissemination of hvKp strains on ISS might pose a risk to the immunocompromised crew members. Moreover, MGEs containing virulent loci could enable horizontal gene transfer to other benign microorganisms on the ISS, possibly enhancing their virulence potential. Additionally, some Klebsiella genomes exhibited genetic divergence from their respective lineages, which we hypothesize results from the unique spaceflight associated environmental pressures. These findings underscore the need to monitor microbial communities in space to comprehend their survival mechanisms and implications for human health. IMPORTANCE The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique, hermetically sealed environment, subject to environmental pressures not encountered on Earth, including microgravity and radiation (cosmic ionising/UV). While bacteria's adaptability during spaceflight remains elusive, recent research suggests that it may be species and even clone-specific. Considering the documented spaceflight-induced suppression of the human immune system, a deper understanding of the genomics of potential human pathogens in space could shed light on species and lineages of medical astromicrobiological significance. In this study, we used hybrid assembly methods and comparative genomics to deliver a comprehensive genomic characterization of 10 Klebsiella isolates retrieved from the ISS. Our analysis unveiled that Klebsiella quasipneumoniae ST138 demonstrates both spatial and temporal persistence aboard the ISS, showing evidence of genomic divergence from its Earth-based ST138 lineage. Moreover, we characterized plasmids from Klebsiella species of ISS origin, which harbored genes for disinfectant resistance and enhanced thermotolerance, suggestin possible adaptive advantages. Furthermore, we identified a mobile genetic element containing a hypervirulence-associated locus belonging to a Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate of the “high-risk” ST101 clone. Our work provides insights into the adaptability and persistence of Klebsiella species during spaceflight, highlighting the importance of understanding the dynamics of potential pathogenic bacteria in such environments.",INTRODUCTION,MATERIALS AND METHODS,RESULTS,DISCUSSION,"MATERIALS AND METHODS Isolation of the strains from the ISS Various locations were sampled on the ISS using polyester wipes, and the metadata associated with the samples and their collections were published elsewhere ( 43 ). Briefly, each wipe was aseptically removed from the zip lock bag and transferred to a 500 mL bottle containing 200 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and concentrated with a concentrating pipette (Innova Prep, Drexel, MO, USA) using a 0.22 µm Hollow Fiber Polysulfone tips (Cat #: CC08022). Suitable aliquots (100 µL) of each sample were plated on Reasoner’s 2A agar in duplicate and incubated at 25°C for 7 days, and well-matured colonies were picked, archived in semisolid R2A (agar media diluted 1:10), and stored at room temperature. A loopful of purified microbial culture was directly subjected to PCR. The targeted fragment was amplified (colony PCR) to amplify the 1.5 kb 16S rRNA gene to identify the bacterial strains. The following primers were used for the 16S rRNA gene amplification: the forward primer, 27F (5′-AGA GTT TGA TCC TGG CTC AG-3′), and the reverse primer, 1492R (5′-GGT TAC CTT GTT ACG ACT T-3′) ( 44 , 45 ). The PCR conditions were as follows: denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles consisting of denaturation at 95°C for 50 s, annealing at 55°C for 50 s, and extension at 72°C for 1 min 30 s and finalized by extension at 72°C for 10 min. The sequencing was performed using 27F and 1492R primers, and the sequences were assembled using SeqMan Pro from DNAStar Lasergene Package (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI, USA). The bacterial sequences were searched against EzTaxon-e database ( 46 ) and the initial identification was based on the closest percentage similarity (>97%) to previously identified microbial type strains. DNA extraction and sequencing Cultures of the 10 Klebsiella strains were grown overnight on MacConkey agar plates at 37°C. DNA extraction was performed using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with no pre-enrichment steps. The extracted DNA was quantified using a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, USA) and the dsDNA High Sensitivity kit (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, USA). DNA purity was evaluated by measuring the absorbance ratio at 260 and 280 nm (A260/280) on a Jenway Genova Nano Micro-volume Spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA). For sequencing, DNA samples with a suitable quantity (>12.5 ng/µL) and purity (A260/280 of 1.80–2.00) were selected for downstream processing. Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing was performed on these samples at Oxford’s Genomics Centre (PE150). In addition, long-read sequencing for the DNA of all 10 isolates was carried out using an Oxford MinION Mk1C platform with a R9.4.1 flow cell (Oxford, UK). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing Antimicrobial susceptibilities for the 10 Klebsiella spp. isolates were determined by the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method for a range of 8 β-lactam and 10 non-β-lactam antibiotics as previously described ( 47 ) (Table S6). The diffusion test was performed on Mueller Hinton agar as a culture medium. Classification into susceptibility categories was determined using the clinical breakpoints provided for Enterobacterales defined by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (v.13.0, 2023) ( 48 ). For nalidixic acid and kanamycin, breakpoints provided by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (30th edition) were applied ( 49 ). K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were utilized as quality controls. Bioinformatic analysis Filtering and assembly For short reads, quality filtering and adapter trimming were carried out using fastp (v0.23.2) ( 50 ). Only reads with a Q score of over 20 were retained. For long reads, adapter trimming was conducted using Porechop (v0.2.4) ( 51 ). Trimmed long reads were quality filtered using filtlong (v0.2.1) and only reads of 1 kbp or more were retained. Hybrid genome assembly was conducted using the hybrid assembly pipeline Unicycler (v0.5.0) ( 52 ) with default settings. The quality of hybrid assemblies was assessed using QUAST (v5.2.0) ( 53 ). Closed genome assemblies were visualized using Bandage (v0.8.1) ( 54 ), separating chromosomal and plasmid sequences. Circular visualization of the chromosomes and plasmids coupled including COG classification of their genetic features was conducted using COGclassifier (v1.0.4) and MGCplotter (v1.0.1). Genomic characterization of resistance, virulence, and plasmids Genome comparison between the 10 ISS strains was also conducted using MGCplotter utilizing K. quasipneumoniae strain IF1SW-B2 as a reference genome (v1.0.1) ( Fig. 1 ). The mobilization and conjugation potential of the plasmids were predicted using the Mobtyper tool from the MOB-suite software package (v3.1.0) ( 55 ). Plasmid ST was determined using the plasmidMLST (v2.0) tool. ANI analysis was carried out using ANIclustermap (v1.1.0). The bacterial chromosomes and plasmids identified were scanned for the presence of ARGs and VFs using Abricate (v.1.0.0) against the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database (card) ( 56 ) and the virulence factor database (vfdb) ( 57 ), respectively. Only results with coverage and identity >90% were considered. The presence of ICEs was assessed using VRprofile2 ( 58 ). Species identification, sequence typing, K and O locus typing, and quantification of the respective virulence and resistance scores were conducted using Kleborate (v2.2.0) ( 10 ) and Kaptive (v2.0.3) ( 59 ). Large scale comparative genomics To compare the ISS Klebsiella genomes with Earthly analogs of the same ST, all available genomes from the STs identified for the ISS strains were retrieved from the Pathogenwatch database (Table S6). Their assemblies were annotated using PROKKA (v1.14.5) ( 60 ). A pan-genome analysis for each ST, which included the corresponding ISS strains and the species typing strain, was conducted using roary (v3.11.2) ( 61 ). Core genome alignment was determined using mafft (v7.47.1) ( 62 ). Phylogenetic analysis was performed to infer the evolutionary relationships among the core gene sequences with RAxML (v.8.2.12) using the General Time Reversible-gamma model with rapid bootstrapping of 200 bootstrapping replicates ( 63 ). The presence-absence results from the pan-genome analysis and the phylogenetic tree generated were visualized using microreact ( 64 ). Data were also visualized using the R programming language. Dedicated dashboards per ST have been generated and are accessible : K. quasipneumoniae ST 3234 ; K. quasipneumoniae ST138 ; K. pneumoniae ST101 , K. aerogenes ST103. Phylogenetic trees displaying branch distances and bootstrap support values are presented in Fig. S2. Hypervirulence multiplex PCR assay An in-house developed and validated multiplex PCR assay, designed to detect hypervirulence in clinical K. pneumoniae isoalates, was used to verify the presence of yersiniabactin identified in strain F3-2P (2). The assay targets the ybtQ gene of the yersiniabactin gene cluster, the iucA gene of the aerobactin gene cluster, and the 16SrRNA gene as a positive control (Table S7). The multiplex PCR was conducted on a SensQuest Thermocycler with the following conditions: 2 min at 50°C, 10 min at 95°C (15 s at 95°C, 1 min at 60°C) × 35.",,Genomic analysis reveals the presence of emerging pathogenic Klebsiella lineages aboard the International Space Station,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10715203/,

During this mission series, six unique strains of Gram-stain-positive bacteria, including two spore-forming and three non-spore-forming species, were isolated from the environmental surfaces of the ISS. The analysis of their 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed > 99% similarities with previously described bacterial species.

Traditional biochemical tests, fatty acid profiling, polar lipid, and cell wall composition analyses were performed to generate phenotypic characterization of these ISS strains. A study of the shotgun metagenomic reads from the ISS samples, from which the novel species were isolated, showed that only 0.1% of the total reads mapped to the novel species, supporting the idea that these novel species are rare in the ISS environments. In-depth annotation of the genomes unveiled a variety of genes linked to amino acid and derivative synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments, and protein metabolism.

Despite its highly controlled environment, characterised by microgravity, increased CO 2 levels, and elevated solar radiation, microorganisms occupy a unique niche. These microbial inhabitants play a significant role in influencing the health and well-being of astronauts on board. One microorganism of particular interest in our study is Enterobacter bugandensis , primarily found in clinical specimens including the human gastrointestinal tract, and also reported to possess pathogenic traits, leading to a plethora of infections. Results Distinct from their Earth counterparts, ISS E. bugandensis strains have exhibited resistance mechanisms that categorise them within the ESKAPE pathogen group, a collection of pathogens recognised for their formidable resistance to antimicrobial treatments. During the 2-year Microbial Tracking 1 mission, 13 strains of multidrug-resistant E. bugandensis were isolated from various locations within the ISS. We have carried out a comprehensive study to understand the genomic intricacies of ISS-derived E. bugandensis in comparison to terrestrial strains, with a keen focus on those associated with clinical infections. We unravel the evolutionary trajectories of pivotal genes, especially those contributing to functional adaptations and potential antimicrobial resistance. A hypothesis central to our study was that the singular nature of the stresses of the space environment, distinct from any on Earth, could be driving these genomic adaptations. Extending our investigation, we meticulously mapped the prevalence and distribution of E. bugandensis across the ISS over time. This temporal analysis provided insights into the persistence, succession, and potential patterns of colonisation of E. bugandensis in space. Furthermore, by leveraging advanced analytical techniques, including metabolic modelling, we delved into the coexisting microbial communities alongside E. bugandensis in the ISS across multiple missions and spatial locations. This exploration revealed intricate microbial interactions, offering a window into the microbial ecosystem dynamics within the ISS. Conclusions Our comprehensive analysis illuminated not only the ways these interactions sculpt microbial diversity but also the factors that might contribute to the potential dominance and succession of E. bugandensis within the ISS environment. The implications of these findings are twofold. Firstly, they shed light on microbial behaviour, adaptation, and evolution in extreme, isolated environments. Secondly, they underscore the need for robust preventive measures, ensuring the health and safety of astronauts by mitigating risks associated with potential pathogenic threats.

Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions. Results In this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool—deepFRI—we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity. Conclusion Our findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.

While bone is typically considered radiation-resistant, fractures frequently occur within the first year of SBRT ( 6 – 11 ). Our purpose was to determine if rapid deterioration of bone occurs in vertebrae post-irradiation (IR). Sixteen male rhesus macaques non-human primates (NHPs) were analyzed after total chest irradiation (IR) to a midplane dose of 10 Gy. Ages at IR varied from 45 – 134 mo. Computed tomography (CT) scans were taken 2 mo prior to IR and 2, 4, 6, and 8 mo post-IR for all animals. Bone mineral density (BMD) and cortical thickness (Ct.Th) were calculated longitudinally for thoracic (T)9, lumbar (L)2, and L4 vertebral bodies; gross morphology and histopathology were assessed per vertebra. Greater mortality (related to pulmonary toxicity) was noted in NHPs < 50 mo at time of IR vs NHPs > 50mo (p = 0.03). Animals older than 50 mo at IR lost Ct.Th in T9 by 2 mo post IR (p = 0.0009), which persisted to 8 mo. In contrast, no loss of Ct.Th was observed in vertebrae out-of-field (L2 and L4). Loss of BMD was observed by 4 mo post-IR for T9, and 6 mo post IR for L2 and L4 (p < 0.01). For NHPs younger than 50 mo at IR, both Ct.Th and BMD decreased in T9, L2, and L4 by 2 mo post-IR (p < 0.05). Regions that exhibited the greatest degree of cortical thinning as determined from CT scans also exhibited increased porosity histologically. Rapid loss of Ct.Th was observed after high dose chest IR in NHPs. Younger age at IR was associated with increased pneumonitis related mortality, as well as greater loss of both BMD and Ct.Th at both in-and out-of-field vertebrae. Older NHPs exhibited rapid loss of BMD and Ct.Th from in-field vertebrae, but only loss of BMD in out of field vertebrae. Bone is sensitive to high dose radiation, and rapid loss of bone structure and density could facilitate fractures.",,,,,,,Cortical thinning and structural bone changes in non-human primates after single-fraction whole-chest irradiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6036641/,

Knee and Hip Joint Cartilage Damage from Combined Spaceflight Hazards of Low-Dose Radiation Less than 1 Gy and Prolonged Hinlimb Unloading. Radiat. Res. 191, 497–506 (2019). Reduced weight bearing, and to a lesser extent radiation, during spaceflight have been shown as potential hazards to astronaut joint health. These hazards combined effect to the knee and hip joints are not well defined, particularly with low-dose exposure to radiation. In this study, we examined the individual and combined effects of varying low-dose radiation (≤1 Gy) and reduced weight bearing on the cartilage of the knee and hip joints. C57BL/6J mice (n = 80) were either tail suspended via hindlimb unloading (HLU) or remained full-weight bearing (ground). On day 6, each group was divided and irradiated with 0 Gy (sham), 0.1 Gy, 0.5 Gy or 1.0 Gy (n = 10/group), yielding eight groups: ground-sham; ground-0.1 Gy; ground-0.5 Gy; ground-1.0 Gy; HLU-sham; HLU-0.1 Gy; HLU-0.5 Gy; and HLU-1.0 Gy. On day 30, the hindlimbs, hip cartilage and serum were collected from the mice. Significant differences were identified statistically between treatment groups and the ground-sham control group, but no significant differences were observed between HLU and/or radiation groups. Contrast-enhanced micro-computed tomography (micro-CECT) demonstrated decrease in volume and thickness at the weight-bearing femoral-tibial cartilage-cartilage contact point in all treatment groups compared to ground-sham. Lower collagen was observed in all groups compared to ground-sham. Circulating serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (sCOMP), a biomarker for ongoing cartilage degradation, was increased in all of the irradiated groups compared to ground-sham, regardless of unloading. Mass spectrometry of the cartilage lining the femoral head and subsequent Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) identified a decrease in cartilage compositional proteins indicative of osteoarthritis. Our findings demonstrate that both individually and combined, HLU and exposure to spaceflight-relevant radiation doses lead to cartilage degradation of the knee and hip with expression of an arthritic phenotype. Moreover, early administration of low-dose irradiation (0.1, 0.5 or 1.0 Gy) causes an active catabolic response in cartilage 24 days postirradiation. Further research is warranted with a focus on the prevention of cartilage degradation from long-term periods of reduced weight bearing and spaceflight-relevant low doses and qualities of radiation.",,,,,,,Knee and Hip Joint Cartilage Damage from Combined Spaceflight Hazards of Low-Dose Radiation Less than 1 Gy and Prolonged Hindlimb Unloading.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6599637/,

The induction of structural chromosome instability is considered to be a driving mechanism of Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis. Homologous recombination repair protects against Cr(VI)-induced chromosome damage, due to its highly accurate repair of Cr(VI)-induced DNA double strand breaks. However, recent studies demonstrate Cr(VI) inhibits homologous recombination repair through the misregulation of RAD51. RAD51 is an essential protein in HR repair that facilitates the search for a homologous sequence. Recent studies show prolonged Cr(VI) exposure prevents proper RAD51 subcellular localization, causing it to accumulate in the cytoplasm. Since nuclear import of RAD51 is crucial to its function, this study investigated the effect of Cr(VI) on the RAD51 nuclear import mediators, RAD51C and BRCA2. We show acute (24 h) Cr(VI) exposure induces the proper localization of RAD51C and BRCA2. In contrast, prolonged (120 h) exposure increased the cytoplasmic localization of both proteins, although RAD51C localization was more severely impaired. These results correlate temporally with the previously reported Cr(VI)-induced RAD51 cytoplasmic accumulation. In addition, we found Cr(VI) does not inhibit interaction between RAD51 and its nuclear import mediators. Altogether, our results suggest prolonged Cr(VI) exposure inhibits the nuclear import of RAD51C, and to a lesser extent, BRCA2, which results in the cytoplasmic accumulation of RAD51. Cr(VI)-induced inhibition of nuclear import may play a key role in its carcinogenic mechanism since the nuclear import of many tumor suppressor proteins and DNA repair proteins is crucial to their function.",,,,,,,Prolonged exposure to particulate chromate inhibits RAD51 nuclear import mediator proteins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5568470/,

Understanding the mechanisms by which spaceflight impacts human health at the molecular level is critical not only for accurately assessing the risks associated with spaceflight, but also for developing effective countermeasures. Over the years, a number of studies have been conducted under real or simulated space conditions. RNA and protein levels in cellular and animal models have been targeted in order to identify pathways affected by spaceflight. Of the many pathways responsive to the space environment, the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) network appears to commonly be affected across many different cell types under the true or simulated spaceflight conditions. NF-κB is of particular interest, as it is associated with many of the spaceflight-related health consequences.

Interestingly, stress hormones influence cellular immune pathways affected by microgravity, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, DNA repair, and T cell activation. These pathways are crucial defense mechanisms that protect the cell from toxins, pathogens, and radiation. Despite the importance of the adrenergic receptor in regulating the immune system, the effect of microgravity on the adrenergic system has been poorly studied. Thus, we elected to investigate the synergistic effects of isoproterenol (a sympathomimetic drug), radiation, and microgravity in nonstimulated immune cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were treated with the sympathomimetic drug isoproterenol, exposed to 0.8 or 2 Gy γ-radiation, and incubated in RWVs. Mixed model regression analyses showed significant synergistic effects on the expression of the β2-adrenergic receptor gene (ADRB2).

To this end, the altered gene expression profile induced by microgravity has been repeatedly queried by microarray and RNA-seq experiments to understand gravitropism. However, the quantification of altered protein abundance in space has been minimally investigated. Results Proteomic (iTRAQ-labelled LC-MS/MS) and transcriptomic (RNA-seq) analyses simultaneously quantified protein and transcript differential expression of three-day old, etiolated Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings grown aboard the International Space Station along with their ground control counterparts. Protein extracts were fractionated to isolate soluble and membrane proteins and analyzed to detect differentially phosphorylated peptides. In total, 968 RNAs, 107 soluble proteins, and 103 membrane proteins were identified as differentially expressed. In addition, the proteomic analyses identified 16 differential phosphorylation events. Proteomic data delivered novel insights and simultaneously provided new context to previously made observations of gene expression in microgravity. There is a sweeping shift in post-transcriptional mechanisms of gene regulation including RNA-decapping protein DCP5, the splicing factors GRP7 and GRP8, and AGO4,. These data also indicate AHA2 and FERONIA as well as CESA1 and SHOU4 as central to the cell wall adaptations seen in spaceflight.

In this study, gene expression and correlation patterns were analyzed for 10 astronauts (8 male and 2 female) using the publicly available microarray dataset E-GEOD-74708. We identified 218 differentially expressed genes between In-flight and Pre-flight and noticed that space travel decreased genome regulation and gene correlations across the entire genome, as well as individual signaling pathways. Furthermore, we systematically developed a shortlist of 32 genes that could be used to monitor astronauts’ health during space travel. Further studies, including microgravity experiments, are warranted to optimize and validate the proposed assay.",1. Introduction,2. Materials and Methods,3. Results and Discussion,3.

MucA is degraded via a proteolysis pathway that frees AlgU from sequestration, activating alginate biosynthesis. Initiation of this pathway normally requires two signals: peptide sequences in unassembled outer-membrane proteins (OMPs) activate the AlgW protease, and unassembled lipopolysaccharides bind periplasmic MucB, releasing MucA and facilitating its proteolysis by activated AlgW. To search for novel alginate regulators, we screened a transposon library in the non-mucoid reference strain PAO1, and identified a mutant that confers mucoidy through overexpression of a protein encoded by the c haperone- u sher p athway gene cupB5 . CupB5-dependent mucoidy occurs through the AlgU pathway and can be reversed by overexpression of MucA or MucB. In the presence of activating OMP peptides, peptides corresponding to a region of CupB5 needed for mucoidy further stimulated AlgW cleavage of MucA in vitro . Moreover, the CupB5 peptide allowed OMP-activated AlgW cleavage of MucA in the presence of the MucB inhibitor. These results support a novel mechanism for conversion to mucoidy in which the proteolytic activity of AlgW and its ability to compete with MucB for MucA is mediated by independent peptide signals.",,,,,,,Overexpression of CupB5 activates alginate overproduction in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by a novel AlgW-dependent mechanism,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4116675/,

We believe that immune cells respond to leakage of “toxic lymph” following trauma causing the attraction of these cells to the perilymphatic space. To test this, we utilized a model of burn on rats to examine changes in a single immune cell population associated with mesenteric lymphatic dysfunction. We examined the ability of serum from these animals to increase permeability in lymphatic endothelial monolayers and disrupt cellular junctions. We also treated burn animals with doxycycline, an inhibitor of microvascular permeability, and observed the effects on immune cell populations, morphometry, and lymphatic endothelial permeability. Burn injury increased the number of MHCII + immune cells along the vessel (>50%). The size and shape of these cells also changed significantly following burn injury. Serum from burn animals increased lymphatic endothelial permeability (∼1.5-fold) and induced breaks in VE-cadherin staining. Doxycycline treatment blocked the accumulation of immune cells along the vessel, whereas serum from doxycycline-treated animals failed to increase lymphatic endothelial permeability. The size of cells along the vessel in doxycycline-treated burn animals was not affected, suggesting that the cells already present on the lymphatic vessels still respond to substances in the lymph. These findings suggest that factors produced during burn can induce lymphatic endothelial barrier disruption and lymph produced during traumatic injury can influence the attraction and morphology of immune cell populations along the vessel.",,,,,,,Burn injury-associated MHCII(+) immune cell accumulation around lymphatic vessels of the mesentery and increased lymphatic endothelial permeability are blocked by doxycycline treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5810432/,

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that bone loss during spaceflight in Low Earth Orbit is primarily associated with site-specific microgravity unloading of weight-bearing sites in the skeleton. Microcomputed tomography and histological analyses of bones from mice space flown on ISS for 37 days in the NASA Rodent Research-1 experiment show significant site-specific cancellous and cortical bone loss occurring in the femur, but not in L2 vertebrae. The lack of bone degenerative effects in the spine in combination with same-animal paired losses in the femur suggests that space radiation levels in Low Earth Orbit or other systemic stresses are not likely to significantly contribute to the observed bone loss. Remarkably, spaceflight is also associated with accelerated progression of femoral head endochondral ossification. This suggests the microgravity environment promotes premature progression of secondary ossification during late stages of skeletal maturation at 21 weeks. Furthermore, mice housed in the NASA ISS Rodent Habitat during 1 g ground controls maintained or gained bone relative to mice housed in standard vivarium cages that showed significant bone mass declines. These findings suggest that housing in the Rodent Habitat with greater topological enrichment from 3D wire-mesh surfaces may promote increased mechanical loading of weight-bearing bones and maintenance of bone mass. In summary, our results indicate that in female mice approaching skeletal maturity, mechanical unloading of weight-bearing sites is the major cause of bone loss in microgravity, while sites loaded predominantly by muscle activity, such as the spine, appear unaffected. Additionally, we identified early-onset of femoral head epiphyseal plate secondary ossification as a novel spaceflight skeletal unloading effect that may lead to premature long bone growth arrest in microgravity.",Introduction,Methods,Results,Discussion,,,37-day microgravity exposure in 16-week female C57BL/6J mice is associated with bone loss specific to weight-bearing skeletal sites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11940681/,

Microgravity is a major component of the spaceflight environment which could have adverse effects on ocular health. The use of centrifugation to exert forces that partially or fully mimic Earth-level gravity in space is a possible countermeasure to mitigate the effects of microgravity on the eye. Therefore, we subjected mice on the International Space Station (ISS) to microgravity (0 G) or artificial gravity by centrifugation at 0.33 G, 0.67 G, and 1 G, and then performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on optic nerve and retinal tissue after returning them to Earth alive. We find that the microgravity environment induces transcriptomic changes in the optic nerve and retina consistent with an increased oxidative stress load, inflammation, apoptosis, and lipid metabolic stress. We also find that adding artificial gravity on board the ISS attenuates the transcriptomic response to microgravity in a dose-dependent manner.

GCR particles (protons and ions) move at nearly the speed of light and easily penetrate space station walls, as well as the human body. Previously, we have shown reactivation of latent herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus, Varicella zoster virus, Epstein–Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus (CMV), during stays at the International Space Station. Given the prevalence of latent CMV and the known propensity of space radiation to cause alterations in many cellular processes, we undertook this study to understand the role of GCR in reactivating latent CMV. Latently infected Kasumi cells with CMV were irradiated with 137 Cs gamma rays, 150 MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon ions, 600 MeV/n iron ions, proton ions, and simulated GCR. The CMV copy number increased significantly in the cells exposed to radiation as compared with the non-irradiated controls. Viral genome sequencing did not reveal significant nucleotide differences among the compared groups. However, transcriptome analysis showed the upregulation of transcription of the UL49 ORF, implicating it in the switch from latent to lytic replication. These findings support our hypothesis that GCR may be a strong contributor to the reactivation of CMV infection seen in ISS crew members.",1. Introduction,4. Materials and Methods,2. Results,3.

C. elegans expressing UNC-89 with a lysine to alanine (KtoA) mutation to inactivate PK2 have normally organized sarcomeres and SR, and normal muscle function. PK2 KtoA mutants have fragmented mitochondria, correlated with more mitochondrially-associated DRP-1. PK2 KtoA mutants have increased ATP levels, increased glycolysis and altered levels of electron transport chain complexes. Muscle mitochondria show increased complex I and decreased complex II basal respiration, each of which cannot be uncoupled.

Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions. Results In this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool—deepFRI—we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity. Conclusion Our findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.

Unintended microbial growth can occur in these environments as in buildings on Earth from elevated moisture, such as from a temporary ventilation system failure. This growth can drive negative health outcomes and degrade building materials. We need a predictive approach for modeling microbial growth in these critical indoor spaces. Results Here, we demonstrate that even short exposures to varying elevated relative humidity can facilitate rapid microbial growth and microbial community composition changes in dust from spacecraft. We modeled fungal growth in dust from the International Space Station using the time-of-wetness framework with activation and deactivation limited growth occurring at 85% and 100% relative humidity, respectively. Fungal concentrations ranged from an average of 4.4 × 10 6 spore equivalents per milligram of dust in original dust with no exposure to relative humidity to up to 2.1 × 10 10 when exposed to 100% relative humidity for 2 weeks. As relative humidity and time-elevated increased, fungal diversity was significantly reduced for both alpha ( Q < 0.05) and beta ( R 2 = 0.307, P = 0.001) diversity metrics. Bacteria were unable to be modeled using the time-of-wetness framework. However, bacterial communities did change based on constant relative humidity incubations for both beta ( R 2 = 0.22, P = 0.001) and alpha diversity decreasing with increasing moisture starting at 85% relative humidity ( Q < 0.05). Conclusion Our results demonstrate that moisture conditions can be used to develop and predict changes in fungal growth and composition onboard human-occupied spacecraft. This predictive model can be expanded upon to include other spacecraft environmental factors such as microgravity, elevated carbon dioxide conditions, and radiation exposure. Understanding microbial growth in spacecraft can help better protect astronaut health, fortify spacecraft integrity, and promote planetary protection as human activity increases in low-Earth orbit, the moon, Mars, and beyond.

Human NK cells were cultured for 48 h under normal gravity and simulated microgravity (sμG), and cytotoxicity against K-562 (CML) and MOLT-4 (T-ALL) cells was measured using standard methodology or under continuous sμG. This brief exposure to sμG markedly reduced NK cytotoxicity against both leukemias, and these deleterious effects were more pronounced in continuous sμG. RNA-seq performed on NK cells from two additional healthy donors provided insight into the mechanism(s) by which sμG reduced cytotoxicity.

Future spaceflight missions will expose crew to extended periods of microgravity among other stressors, the effects of which on cardiovascular health are not fully known. In this study, we determined cardiac responses to extended microgravity exposure using the rat hindlimb unloading (HU) model. We hypothesized that exposure to prolonged simulated microgravity and subsequent recovery would lead to increased oxidative damage and altered expression of genes involved in the oxidative response. To test this hypothesis, we examined hearts of male (three and nine months of age) and female (3 months of age) Long–Evans rats that underwent HU for various durations up to 90 days and reambulated up to 90 days post-HU. Results indicate sex-dependent changes in oxidative damage marker 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and antioxidant gene expression in left ventricular tissue. Three-month-old females displayed elevated 8-OHdG levels after 14 days of HU while age-matched males did not. In nine-month-old males, there were no differences in 8-OHdG levels between HU and normally loaded control males at any of the timepoints tested following HU. RNAseq analysis of left ventricular tissue from nine-month-old males after 14 days of HU revealed upregulation of pathways involved in pro-inflammatory signaling, immune cell activation and differential expression of genes associated with cardiovascular disease progression. Taken together, these findings provide a rationale for targeting antioxidant and immune pathways and that sex differences should be taken into account in the development of countermeasures to maintain cardiovascular health in space.",1.

The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca 2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump is responsible for bringing Ca 2+ from the cytosol into its storage site, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), at the expense of ATP. We have recently demonstrated that, in the soleus of space-flown mice, the Ca 2+ uptake ability of the SERCA pump is severely impaired and this may be attributed to increases in reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS), to which SERCA is highly susceptible. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether treatment with the antioxidant, Manganese(III) meso -tetrakis( N -n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE), could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction. We received soleus muscles from the rodent research 18 mission which had male mice housed on the international space station for 35 days and treated with either saline or BuOE. Spaceflight significantly reduced the soleus:body mass ratio and significantly increased SERCA’s ionophore ratio, a measure of SR Ca 2+ leak, and 4-HNE content (marker of RONS), none of which could be rescued by BuOE treatment. In conclusion, we find that spaceflight induces significant soleus muscle atrophy and SR Ca 2+ leak that cannot be counteracted with BuOE treatment. Future work should investigate alternative therapeutics that are specifically aimed at increasing SERCA activation or reducing Ca 2+ leak.",,Methods,,,,,Spaceflight increases sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak and this cannot be counteracted with BuOE treatment,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11271499/,
